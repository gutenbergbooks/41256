<h3><a name="pref" id="pref"></a>PREFACE</h3>

<p>The most interesting, and the most useful, fictions, are, perhaps,
such, as delineating the progress, and tracing the consequences, of
one strong, indulged, passion, or prejudice, afford materials, by
which the philosopher may calculate the powers of the human mind,
and learn the springs which set it in motion&mdash;'Understanding, and
talents,' says Helvetius, 'being nothing more, in men, than the
produce of their desires, and particular situations.' Of the passion of
terror Mrs Radcliffe has made admirable use in her ingenious
romances.&mdash;In the novel of Caleb Williams, curiosity in the hero, and
the love of reputation in the soul-moving character of Falkland,
fostered into ruling passions, are drawn with a masterly hand.</p>

<p>For the subject of these Memoirs, a more universal sentiment is
chosen&mdash;a sentiment hackneyed in this species of composition,
consequently more difficult to treat with any degree of originality;&mdash;yet,
to accomplish this, has been the aim of the author; with what
success, the public will, probably, determine.</p>

<p>Every writer who advances principles, whether true or false, that
have a tendency to set the mind in motion, does good. Innumerable
mistakes have been made, both moral and philosophical:&mdash;while
covered with a sacred and mysterious veil, how are they to be
detected? From various combinations and multiplied experiments,
truth, only, can result. Free thinking, and free speaking, are the virtue
and the characteristics of a rational being:&mdash;there can be no
argument which mitigates against them in one instance, but what
equally mitigates against them in all; every principle must be doubted,
before it will be examined and proved.</p>

<p>It has commonly been the business of fiction to pourtray
characters, not as they really exist, but, as, we are told, they ought to
be&mdash;a sort of <i>ideal perfection</i>, in which nature and passion are melted
away, and jarring attributes wonderfully combined.</p>

<p>In delineating the character of Emma Courtney, I had not in view
these fantastic models: I meant to represent her, as a human being,
loving virtue while enslaved by passion, liable to the mistakes and
weaknesses of our fragile nature.&mdash;Let those readers, who feel
inclined to judge with severity the extravagance and eccentricity of
her conduct, look into their own hearts; and should they there find no
record, traced by an accusing spirit, to soften the asperity of their
censures&mdash;yet, let them bear in mind, that the errors of my heroine
were the offspring of sensibility; and that the result of her hazardous
experiment is calculated to operate as a <i>warning</i>, rather than as an
example.&mdash;The philosopher&mdash;who is not ignorant, that light and
shade are more powerfully contrasted in minds rising above the
common level; that, as rank weeks take strong root in a fertile soil,
vigorous powers not unfrequently produce fatal mistakes and
pernicious exertions; that character is the produce of a lively and
constant affection&mdash;may, possibly, discover in these Memoirs traces
of reflection, and of some attention to the ph&aelig;nomena of the human
mind.</p>

<p>Whether the incidents, or the characters, are copied from life, is of
little importance&mdash;The only question is, if the <i>circumstances</i>, and
situations, are altogether improbable? If not&mdash;whether the consequences
<i>might</i> not have followed from the circumstances?&mdash;This is a
grand question, applicable to all the purposes of education, morals,
and legislation&mdash;<i>and on this I rest my moral</i>&mdash;'Do men gather figs of
thorns, or grapes of thistles?' asked a moralist and a reformer.</p>

<p>Every <i>possible</i> incident, in works of this nature, might, perhaps, be
rendered <i>probable</i>, were a sufficient regard paid to the more minute,
delicate, and connecting links of the chain. Under this impression, I
chose, as the least arduous, a simple story&mdash;and, even in that, the
fear of repetition, of prolixity, added, it may be, to a portion of
indolence, made me, in some parts, neglectful of this rule:&mdash;yet, in
tracing the character of my heroine from her birth, I had it in view.
For the conduct of my hero, I consider myself less responsible&mdash;it
was not <i>his</i> memoirs that I professed to write.</p>

<p>I am not sanguine respecting the success of this little publication.
It is truly observed, by the writer of a late popular novel<a name="fn_1r" id="fn_1r"></a><a href="#fn_1"><sup><span class="small">1</span></sup></a>&mdash;'That an
author, whether good or bad, or between both, is an animal whom
every body is privileged to attack; for, though all are not able to write
books, all conceive themselves able to judge them. A bad composition
carries with it its own punishment&mdash;contempt and ridicule:&mdash;a good
one excites envy, and (frequently) entails upon its author a thousand
mortifications.'</p>

<p>To the feeling and the thinking few, this production of an active
mind, in a season of impression, rather than of leisure, is presented.</p>

<h3>TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY</h3>

<p>Rash young man!&mdash;why do you tear from my heart the affecting
narrative, which I had hoped no cruel necessity would ever have
forced me to review?&mdash;Why do you oblige me to recall the bitterness
of my past life, and to renew images, the remembrance of which,
even at this distant period, harrows up my soul with inconceivable
misery?&mdash;But your happiness is at stake, and every selfish
consideration vanishes.&mdash;Dear and sacred deposit of an adored and
lost friend!&mdash;for whose sake I have consented to hold down, with
struggling, suffocating reluctance, the loathed and bitter portion of
existence;&mdash;shall I expose your ardent mind to the incessant conflict
between truth and error&mdash;shall I practise the disingenuousness, by
which my peace has been blasted&mdash;shall I suffer you to run the wild
career of passion&mdash;shall I keep back the recital, written upon my own
mind in characters of blood, which may preserve the child of my
affections from destruction?</p>

<p>Ah! why have you deceived me?&mdash;Has a six months' absence
obliterated from your remembrance the precept I so earnestly and
incessantly laboured to inculcate&mdash;the value and importance of
unequivocal sincerity? A precept, which I now take shame to myself
for not having more implicitly observed! Had I supposed your
affection for Joanna more than a boyish partiality; had I not believed
that a few months' absence would entirely erase it from your
remembrance; had I not been assured that her heart was devoted to
another object, a circumstance of which she had herself frankly
informed you; I should not now have distrusted your fortitude, when
obliged to wound your feelings with the intelligence&mdash;that the
woman, whom you have so wildly persecuted, was, yesterday, united
to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TO THE SAME</h3>

<p>I resume my pen. Your letter, which Joanna a few days since put
into my hands, has cost me&mdash;Ah! my Augustus, my friend, my son&mdash;what
has it not cost me, and what impressions has it not renewed?
I perceive the vigour of your mind with terror and exultation. But you
are mistaken! Were it not for the insuperable barrier that separates
you, for ever, from your hopes, perseverance itself, however active,
however incessant, may fail in attaining its object. Your ardent
reasoning, my interesting and philosophic young friend, though not
unconsequential, is a finely proportioned structure, resting on an airy
foundation. The science of morals is not incapable of demonstration,
but we want a more extensive knowledge of particular facts, on
which, in any given circumstance, firmly to establish our data.&mdash;Yet,
be not discouraged; exercise your understanding, think freely,
investigate every opinion, disdain the rust of antiquity, raise systems,
invent hypotheses, and, by the absurdities they involve, seize on the
clue of truth. Rouse the nobler energies of your mind; be not the
slave of your passions, neither dream of eradicating them. Sensation
generates interest, interest passion, passion forces attention, attention
supplies the powers, and affords the means of attaining its end: in
proportion to the degree of interest, will be that of attention and
power. Thus are talents produced. Every man is born with sensation,
with the aptitude of receiving impressions; the force of those
impressions depends on a thousand circumstances, over which he has
little power; these circumstances form the mind, and determine the
future character. We are all the creatures of education; but in that
education, what we call chance, or accident, has so great a share, that
the wisest preceptor, after all his cares, has reason to tremble: one
strong affection, one ardent incitement, will turn, in an instant, the
whole current of our thoughts, and introduce a new train of ideas and
associations.</p>

<p>You may perceive that I admit the general truths of your reasoning;
but I would warn you to be careful in their particular application; a
long train of patient and laborious experiments must precede our
deductions and conclusions. The science of mind is not less
demonstrative, and far more important, than the science of Newton;
but we must proceed on similar principles. The term <i>metaphysics</i> has
been, perhaps, justly defined&mdash;the first <i>principles of arts and sciences</i>.<a name="fn_2r" id="fn_2r"></a><a href="#fn_2"><sup><span class="small">2</span></sup></a>
Every discovery of genius, resulting from a fortunate combination of
circumstances, may be resolved into simple facts; but in this
<ins title="original has investigatation">investigation</ins> we must be patient, attentive, indefatigable; we must
be content to arrive at truth through many painful mistakes and
consequent sufferings.&mdash;Such appears to be the constitution of man!</p>

<p>To shorten and meliorate your way, I have determined to sacrifice
every inferior consideration. I have studied your character: I perceive,
with joy, that its errors are the ardent excesses of a generous mind. I
loved your father with a fatal and unutterable tenderness: time has
softened the remembrance of his faults.&mdash;Our noblest qualities,
without incessant watchfulness, are liable insensibly to shade into
vices&mdash;but his virtues and <i>misfortunes</i>, in which my own were so
intimately blended, are indelibly engraven on my heart.</p>

<p>A mystery has hitherto hung over your birth. The victim of my own
ardent passions, and the errors of one whose memory will ever be
dear to me, I prepare to withdraw the veil&mdash;a veil, spread by an importunate,
but, I fear, a mistaken tenderness. Learn, then, from the
incidents of my life, entangled with those of his to whom you owe
your existence, a more striking and affecting lesson than abstract
philosophy can ever afford.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_I" id="ch_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>The events of my life have been few, and have in them nothing very
uncommon, but the effects which they have produced on my mind;
yet, that mind they have helped to form, and this in the eye of
philosophy, or affection, may render them not wholly uninteresting.
While I trace them, they convince me of the irresistible power of
circumstances, modifying and controuling our characters, and
introducing, mechanically, those associations and habits which make
us what we are; for without outward impressions we should be
nothing.</p>

<p>I know not how far to go back, nor where to begin; for in many
cases, it may be in all, a foundation is laid for the operations of our
minds, years&mdash;nay, ages&mdash;previous to our birth. I wish to be brief, yet
to omit no one connecting link in the chain of causes, however
minute, that I conceive had any important consequences in the
formation of my mind, or that may, probably, be useful to your's.</p>

<p>My father was a man of some talents, and of a superior rank in life,
but dissipated, extravagant, and profligate. My mother, the daughter
of a rich trader, and the sole heiress of his fortunes, allured by the
specious address and fashionable manners of my father, sacrificed to
empty shew the prospect of rational and dignified happiness. My
father courted her hand to make himself master of her ample
possessions: dazzled by vanity, and misled by self-love, she married
him;&mdash;found, when too late, her error; bitterly repented, and died in
child bed the twelfth month of her marriage, after having given birth
to a daughter, and commended it, with her dying breath, to the care
of a sister (the daughter of her mother by a former marriage), an
amiable, sensible, and worthy woman, who had, a few days before,
lost a lovely and promising infant at the breast, and received the little
Emma as a gift from heaven, to supply its place.</p>

<p>My father, plunged in expence and debauchery, was little moved
by these domestic distresses. He held the infant a moment in his
arms, kissed it, and willingly consigned it to the guardianship of its
maternal aunt.</p>

<p>It will here be necessary to give a sketch of the character, situation,
and family, of this excellent woman; each of which had an important
share in forming the mind of her charge to those dispositions, and
feelings, which irresistibly led to the subsequent events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_II" id="ch_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>Mr and Mrs Melmoth, my uncle and aunt, married young, purely
from motives of affection. Mr Melmoth had an active, ardent mind,
great benevolence of heart, a sweet and chearful temper, and a liberal
manner of thinking, though with few advantages of education: he
possessed, also, a sanguine disposition, a warm heart, a generous
spirit, and an integrity which was never called in question. Mrs
Melmoth's frame was delicate and fragile; she had great sensibility,
quickness of perception, some anxiety of temper, and a refined and
romantic manner of thinking, acquired from the perusal of the old
romances, a large quantity of which, belonging to a relation, had, in
the early periods of her youth, been accidentally deposited in a spare
room in her father's house. These qualities were mingled with a
devotional spirit, a little bordering on fanatacism. My uncle did not
exactly resemble an Orlando, or an Oroondates, but he was fond of
reading; and having the command of a ship in the West India trade,
had, during his voyages in fine weather, time to indulge in this
propensity; by which means he was a tolerable proficient in the belles
lettres, and could, on occasion, quote Shakespeare, scribble poetry,
and even philosophize with Pope and Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>Mr Melmoth was one-and-twenty, his bride nineteen, when they
were united. They possessed little property; but the one was
enterprizing and industrious, the other careful and &oelig;conomical; and
both, with hearts glowing with affection for each other, saw cheering
hope and fairy prospects dancing before their eyes. Every thing
succeeded beyond their most sanguine expectations. My uncle's
cheerful and social temper, with the fairness and liberality of his
dealings, conciliated the favour of the merchants. His understanding
was superior, and his manners more courteous, than the generality of
persons in his line of life: his company was eagerly courted, and no
vessel stood a chance of being freighted till his had its full cargo.</p>

<p>His voyages were not long, and frequent absences and meetings
kept alive between him and my aunt, the hopes, the fears, the
anxieties, and the transports of love. Their family soon increased, but
this was a new source of joy to Mr Melmoth's affectionate heart. A
walk or a ride in the country, with his wife and little ones, he
accounted his highest relaxation:&mdash;on these occasions he gave
himself up to a sweet and lively pleasure; would clasp them
alternately to his breast, and with eyes overflowing with tears of
delight, repeat Thomson's charming description of the joys of
virtuous love&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">'Where nothing strikes the eye but sights of bliss,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">All various nature pressing on the heart!'</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was the first picture that struck my young imagination, for I was,
in all respects, considered as the adopted child of the family.</p>

<p>This prosperity received little other interruption than from my
uncle's frequent absences, and the pains and cares of my aunt in
bringing into the world, and nursing, a family of children. Mr
Melmoth's successful voyages, at rather earlier than forty years of
age, enabled him to leave the sea, and to carry on an extensive
mercantile employment in the metropolis.&mdash;At this period his health
began to be injured by the progress of a threatening internal disorder;
but it had little effect either on his spirits or activity. His business
every day became wider, and his attention to it was unremitted,
methodical, and indefatigable. His hours of relaxation were devoted
to his family and social enjoyment; at these times he never suffered
the cares of the counting-house to intrude;&mdash;he was the life of every
company, and the soul of every pleasure.</p>

<p>He at length assumed a more expensive style of living; took a
house in the country (for the charms of which he had ever a peculiar
taste) as a summer residence; set up an equipage, increased the
number of his servants, and kept an open and hospitable, though not
a luxurious, table.</p>

<p>The hours fled on downy pinions; his wife rested on him, his
children caught sunshine from his smiles; his domestics adored him,
and his acquaintance vied with each other in paying him respect. His
life, he frequently repeated, had been a series of unbroken success.
His religion, for he laid no stress on forms, was a sentiment of
grateful and fervent love.&mdash;'<i>God is love</i>,' he would say, 'and the
affectionate, benevolent heart is his temple.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_III" id="ch_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>It will now be necessary, for the development of my own particular
character, again to revert to earlier periods.&mdash;A few days before my
birth, my aunt had lost (as already related) a lovely female infant,
about four months old, and she received me, from the hands of my
dying mother, as a substitute.&mdash;From these tender and affecting
circumstances I was nursed and attended with peculiar care. My
uncle's ship (it being war time) was then waiting for a convoy at
Portsmouth, where he was joined by his wife: she carried me with
her, and, tenderly watchful over my safety, took me on all their little
excursions, whether by sea or land: I hung at her breast, or rested in
her arms, and her husband, or attendant, alternately relieved her.&mdash;Plump,
smiling, placid, happy, I never disturbed her rest, and the
little Emma was the darling of her kind guardians, and the plaything
of the company.</p>

<p>At the age at which it was thought necessary to wean me, I was
sent from my tender nurse for that purpose, and consigned to the
care of a stranger, with whom I quickly pined myself into a jaundice
and bilious fever. My aunt dare not visit me during this short
separation, she was unable to bear my piercing cries of anguish at her
departure. If a momentary sensation, at that infantine period, deserve
the appellation, I might call this my first affectionate sorrow. I have
frequently thought that the tenderness of this worthy woman
generated in my infant disposition that susceptibility, that lively
propensity to attachment, to which I have through life been a martyr.
On my return to my friends, I quickly regained my health and spirits;
was active, blythsome, ran, bounded, sported, romped; always light,
gay, alert, and full of glee. At church, (whither on Sunday I was
accustomed to accompany the family) I offended all the pious ladies
in our vicinity by my gamesome tricks, and avoided the reprimands of
my indulgent guardians by the drollery and good humour which
accompanied them.</p>

<p>When myself and my little cousins had wearied ourselves with play,
their mother, to keep us quiet in an evening, while her husband wrote
letters in an adjoining apartment, was accustomed to relate (for our
entertainment) stories from the Arabian Nights, Turkish Tales, and
other works of like marvellous import. She recited them circumstantially,
and these I listened to with ever new delight: the more they
excited vivid emotions, the more wonderful they were, the greater
was my transport: they became my favourite amusement, and
produced, in my young mind, a strong desire of learning to read the
books which contained such enchanting stores of entertainment.</p>

<p>Thus stimulated, I learned to read quickly, and with facility. My
uncle took pleasure in assisting me; and, with parental partiality,
thought he discovered, in the ardour and promptitude with which I
received his instructions, the dawn of future talents. At six years old I
read aloud before company, with great applause, my uncle's favourite
authors, Pope's Homer, and Thomson's Seasons, little comprehending
either. Emulation was roused, and vanity fostered: I learned to
recite verses, to modulate my tones of voice, and began to think
myself a wonderful scholar.</p>

<p>Thus, in peace and gaiety, glided the days of my childhood.
Caressed by my aunt, flattered by her husband, I grew vain and self-willed;
my desires were impetuous, and brooked no delay; my
affections were warm, and my temper irascible; but it was the glow of
a moment, instantly subsiding on conviction, and when conscious of
having committed injustice, I was ever eager to repair it, by a
profusion of caresses and acknowledgements. Opposition would
always make me vehement, and coercion irritated me to violence; but
a kind look, a gentle word, a cool expostulation&mdash;softened, melted,
arrested, me, in the full career of passion. Never, but once, do I
recollect having received a blow; but the boiling rage, the cruel
tempest, the deadly vengeance it excited, in my mind, I now
remember with shuddering.</p>

<p>Every day I became more attached to my books; yet, not less fond
of active play; stories were still my passion, and I sighed for a
romance that would never end. In my sports with my companions, I
acted over what I had read: I was alternately the valiant knight&mdash;the
gentle damsel&mdash;the adventurous mariner&mdash;the daring robber&mdash;the
courteous lover&mdash;and the airy coquet. Ever inventive, my young
friends took their tone from me. I hated the needle:&mdash;my aunt was
indulgent, and not an hour passed unamused:&mdash;my resources were
various, fantastic, and endless. Thus, for the first twelve years of my
life, fleeted my days in joy and innocence. I ran like the hind, frisked
like the kid, sang like the lark, was full of vivacity, health, and
animation; and, excepting some momentary bursts of passion and
impatience, awoke every day to new enjoyment, and retired to rest
fatigued with pleasure.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_IV" id="ch_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>At this period, by the command of my father, I was sent to boarding
school.&mdash;Ah! never shall I forget the contrast I experienced. I was an
alien and a stranger;&mdash;no one loved, caressed, nor cared for me;&mdash;my
actions were all constrained;&mdash;I was obliged to sit poring over needle
work, and forbidden to prate;&mdash;my body was tortured into forms, my
mind coerced, and talks imposed upon me, grammar and French,
mere words, that conveyed to me no ideas. I loved my guardians with
passion&mdash;my tastes were all passions&mdash;they tore themselves from my
embraces with difficulty. I sat down, after their departure, and wept&mdash;bitter
tears&mdash;sobbed convulsively&mdash;my griefs were unheeded, and my
sensibility ridiculed&mdash;I neither gave nor received pleasure. After the
rude stare of curiosity, ever wounding to my feelings, was gratified, I
was left to sob alone.</p>

<p>At length, one young lady, with a fair face and a gentle demeanour,
came and seated herself beside me. She spoke, in a soft voice, words
of sympathy&mdash;my desolate heart fluttered at the sound. I looked at
her&mdash;her features were mild and sweet; I dried my tears, and
determined that she should be my friend.&mdash;My spirits became
calmer, and for a short time I indulged in this relief; but, on enquiry,
I found my fair companion had already a selected favourite, and that
their amity was the admiration of the school.&mdash;Proud, jealous,
romantic&mdash;I could not submit to be the second in her esteem&mdash;I
shunned her, and returned her caresses with coldness.</p>

<p>The only mitigation I now felt to the anguish that had seized my
spirits, was in the hours of business. I was soon distinguished for
attention and capacity; but my governness being with-held, by an
infirm constitution, from the duties of her office, I was consigned,
with my companions, to ignorant, splenetic, teachers, who encouraged
not my emulation, and who sported with the acuteness of my
sensations. In the intervals from school hours I fought and procured
books.&mdash;These were often wantonly taken from me, as a punishment
for the most trivial offence; and, when my indignant spirit broke out
into murmurs and remonstrance, I was constrained to learn, by way
of penance, chapters in the Proverbs of Solomon, or verses from the
French testament. To revenge myself, I satirized my tyrants in
doggrel rhymes: my writing master also came in for a share of this
little malice; and my productions, wretched enough, were handed
round the school with infinite applause. Sunk in sullen melancholy,
in the hours of play I crept into corners, and disdained to be amused;&mdash;home
appeared to me to be the Eden from which I was driven, and
there my heart and thoughts incessantly recurred.</p>

<p>My uncle from time to time addressed to me&mdash;with little presents&mdash;kind,
pleasant, affectionate notes&mdash;and these I treasured up as
sacred relics. A visit of my guardians was a yet more tumultuous
pleasure; but it always left me in increased anguish. Some robberies
had been committed on the road to town.&mdash;After parting with my
friends, I have laid awake the whole night, conjuring up in my
imagination all the tragic accidents I had ever heard or read of, and
persuading myself some of them must have happened to these darling
objects of my affection.</p>

<p>Thus passed the first twelvemonth of my exile from all I loved;
during which time it was reported, by my school-fellows, that I had
never been seen to smile. After the vacations, I was carried back to
my prison with agonizing reluctance, to which in the second year I
became, however, from habit, better reconciled. I learned music, was
praised and encouraged by my master, and grew fond of it; I
contracted friendships, and regained my vivacity; from a forlorn,
unsocial, being, I became, once more, lively, active, enterprising,&mdash;the
soul of all amusement, and the leader of every innocently
mischievous frolic. At the close of another year I left school. I kept up
a correspondence for some time with a few of my young friends, and
my effusions were improved and polished by my paternal uncle.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_V" id="ch_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>This period, which I had anticipated with rapture, was soon clouded
by the gradual decay, and premature death, of my revered and
excellent guardian. He sustained a painful and tedious sickness with
unshaken fortitude;&mdash;with more, with chearfulness. I knelt by his
bedside on the day of his decease; and, while I bathed his hand with
my tears, caught hope from the sweet, the placid, serenity of his
countenance, and could not believe the terrors of dissolution near.</p>

<p>'The last sentiment of my heart,' said he, 'is gratitude to the Being
who has given me so large a portion of good; and I resign my family
into his hands with confidence.'</p>

<p>He awoke from a short slumber, a few minutes before his death.&mdash;'Emma,'
said he, in a faint voice, (as I grasped his cold hand between
both mine) turning upon me a mild, yet dying, eye, 'I have had a
pleasant sleep&mdash;Be a good girl, and comfort your aunt!'&mdash;</p>

<p>He expired without a groan, or a struggle&mdash;'His death was the
serene evening of a beautiful day!' I gazed on his lifeless remains, the
day before their interment, and the features still wore the same
placid, smiling benignity. I was then about fourteen years of age,&mdash;this
first emotion of real sorrow rent my heart asunder!</p>

<p>The sensations of Mrs Melmoth were those of agonizing,
suffocating anguish:&mdash;the fair prospect of domestic felicity was veiled
for ever! This was the second strong impression which struck my
opening mind. Many losses occurred, in consequence of foreign
connections, in the settlement of Mr Melmoth's affairs.&mdash;The family
found their fortunes scanty, and their expectations limited:&mdash;their
numerous fair-professing acquaintance gradually deserted them, and
they sunk into &oelig;conomical retirement; but they continued to be
respectable, because they knew how to contract their wants, and to
preserve their independence.</p>

<p>My aunt, oppressed with sorrow, could be roused only by settling
the necessary plans for the future provision of her family. Occupied
with these concerns, or absorbed in grief, we were left for some time
to run wild. Months revolved ere the tender sorrows of Mrs Melmoth
admitted of any mitigation: they at length yielded only to tender
melancholy. My wonted amusements were no more; a deep gloom
was spread over our once cheerful residence; my avidity for books
daily increased; I subscribed to a circulating library, and frequently
read, or rather devoured&mdash;little careful in the selection&mdash;from ten to
fourteen novels in a week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_VI" id="ch_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>My father satisfied himself, after the death of my beloved uncle, with
making a short and formal visit of condolence to the family, and
proposing either my return to school, or to pay an annual stipend
(which Mr and Mrs Melmoth had hitherto invariably refused) for
defraying the expences of my continuance and board with the amiable
family by which I had been so kindly nurtured. I shrunk from the
cold and careless air of a man whom I had never been able to teach
my heart either to love or honour; and throwing my arms round the
neck of my maternal aunt, murmured a supplication, mingled with
convulsive sobs, that she would not desert me. She returned my
caresses affectionately, and entreated my father to permit me to
remain with her; adding, that it was her determination to endeavour
to rouse and strengthen her mind, for the performance of those
pressing duties&mdash;the education of her beloved children, among whom
she had ever accounted her Emma&mdash;which now devolved wholly
upon her.</p>

<p>My father made no objection to this request; but observed, that
notwithstanding he had a very favourable opinion of her heart and
understanding, and considered himself indebted to her, and to her
deceased husband, for their goodness to Emma, he was nevertheless
apprehensive that the girl had been weakened and spoiled by their
indulgence;&mdash;that his own health was at present considerably injured;&mdash;that
it was probable he might not survive many years;&mdash;in which
case, he frankly confessed, he had enjoyed life too freely to be able to
make much provision for his daughter. It would therefore, he
conceived, be more judicious to prepare and strengthen my mind to
encounter, with fortitude, some hardships and rude shocks, to which
I might be exposed, than to foster a sensibility, which he already
perceived, with regret, was but too acute. For which purpose, he
desired I might spend one day in every week at his house in Berkley-square,
when he should put such books into my hands [he had been
informed I had a tolerable capacity] as he judged would be useful to
me; and, in the intervals of his various occupations and amusements,
assist me himself with occasional remarks and reflections. Any little
accomplishments which Mrs Melmoth might judge necessary for,
and suitable to, a young woman with a small fortune, and which
required the assistance of a master, he would be obliged to her if she
would procure for me, and call upon him to defray the additional
expence.</p>

<p>He then, looking on his watch, and declaring he had already
missed an appointment, took his leave, after naming Monday as the
day on which he should constantly expect my attendance in Berkley-square.</p>

<p>Till he left the room I had not courage to raise my eyes from the
ground&mdash;my feelings were harrowed up&mdash;the tone of his voice was
discordant to my ears. The only idea that alleviated the horror of my
weekly punishment (for so I considered the visits to Berkley-square)
was the hope of reading new books, and of being suffered to range
uncountroled through an extensive and valuable library, for such I
had been assured was Mr Courtney's. I still retained my passion for
adventurous tales, which, even while at school, I was enabled to
gratify by means of one of the day-boarders, who procured for me
romances from a neighbouring library, which at every interval of
leisure I perused with inconceivable avidity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_VII" id="ch_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>The following Monday I prepared to attend Mr Courtney. On
arriving at his house, and announcing my name, a servant conducted
me into his master's dressing-room. I appeared before him with
trembling steps, downcast eyes, and an averted face.</p>

<p>'Look up, child!' said my father, in an imperious tone. 'If you are
conscious of no crime, why all this ridiculous confusion?'</p>

<p>I struggled with my feelings: the tone and manner in which I was
addressed gave me an indignant sensation:&mdash;a deeper suffusion than
that of modesty, the glow of wounded pride, burnt in my cheeks:&mdash;I
turned quick, gazed in the face of Mr Courtney with a steady eye,
and spoke a few words, in a firm voice, importing&mdash;that I attended by
his desire, and waited his direction.</p>

<p>He regarded me with somewhat less <i>hauteur</i>, and, while he
finished dressing, interrogated me respecting the books I had read,
and the impression they had left on my mind. I replied with
simplicity, and without evasion. He soon discovered that my
imagination had been left to wander unrestrained in the fairy fields of
fiction; but that, of historical facts, and the science of the world, I was
entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>'It is as I apprehended,' said he:&mdash;'your fancy requires a <i>rein</i> rather
than a <i>spur</i>. Your studies, for the future, must be of a soberer nature,
or I shall have you mistake my valet for a prince in disguise, my
house for a haunted castle, and my rational care for your future
welfare for barbarous tyranny.'</p>

<p>I felt a poignant and suffocating sensation, too complicated to bear
analyzing, and followed Mr Courtney in silence to the library. My
heart bounded when, on entering a spacious room, I perceived on
either side a large and elegant assortment of books, regularly
arranged in glass cases, and I longed to be left alone, to expatiate
freely in these treasures of entertainment. But I soon discovered, to
my inexpressible mortification, that the cases were locked, and that in
this intellectual feast I was not to be my own purveyor. My father,
after putting into my hands the lives of Plutarch, left me to my
meditations; informing me, that he should probably dine at home
with a few friends, at five o'clock, when he should expect my
attendance at the table.</p>

<p>I opened my book languidly, after having examined through the
glass doors the titles of those which were with-held from me. I felt a
kind of disgust to what I considered as a task imposed, and read a
few pages carelessly, gazing at intervals through the windows into the
square.&mdash;But my attention, as I proceeded, was soon forcibly
arrested, my curiosity excited, and my enthusiasm awakened. The
hours passed rapidly&mdash;I perceived not their flight&mdash;and at five
o'clock, when summoned to dinner, I went down into the dining-room,
my mind pervaded with republican ardour, my sentiments
elevated by a high-toned philosophy, and my bosom glowing with the
virtues of patriotism.</p>

<p>I found with Mr Courtney company of both sexes, to whom he
presented me on my entrance. Their easy compliments disconcerted
me, and I shrunk, abashed, from the bold and curious eyes of the
gentlemen. During the repast I ate little, but listened in silence to
every thing that passed.</p>

<p>The theatres were the first topic of conversation, Venice Preserved
had been acted the preceding evening, and from discussing the play,
the conversation took a political turn. A gentleman that happened to
be seated next me, who spoke fluently, looking around him every
moment for approbation, with apparent self-applause, gave the
discourse a tone of gallantry, declaring&mdash;'Pierre to be a noble fellow,
and that the loss of a mistress was a sufficient excuse for treason and
conspiracy, even though the country had been deluged in blood and
involved in conflagration.'</p>

<p>'And the mistresses of all his fellow citizens destroyed of course;'&mdash;said
a gentleman coolly, on the opposite side of the table.</p>

<p>Oh! that was not a consideration, every thing must give place when
put in competition with certain feelings. 'What, young lady,'
(suddenly turning to me) 'do you think a lover would not risque, who
was in fear of losing you?'</p>

<p>Good God! what a question to an admirer of the grecian heroes! I
started, and absolutely shuddered. I would have replied, but my
words died away upon my lips in inarticulate murmurs. My father
observed and enjoyed my distress.</p>

<p>'The worthies of whom you have been reading, Emma, lived in
ancient times. <ins title="original has Arisides">Aristides</ins> the just, would have made but a poor figure
among our modern men of fashion!'</p>

<p>'This lady reads, then,'&mdash;said our accomplished coxcomb&mdash;'Heavens,
Mr Courtney! you will spoil all her feminine graces;
knowledge and learning, are unsufferably masculine in a <ins title="original has women">woman</ins>&mdash;born
only for the soft solace of man! The mind of a young lady
should be clear and unsullied, like a sheet of white paper, or her own
fairer face: lines of thinking destroy the dimples of beauty; aping the
reason of man, they lose the exquisite, <i>fascinating</i> charm, in which
consists their true empire;&mdash;Then strongest, when most weak&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr><td align="right">"Loveliest in their fears&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">And by this silent adulation, soft,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">To their protection more engaging man."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>'Pshaw!' replied Mr Courtney, a little peevishly&mdash;'you will
persuade Emma, that the age of chivalry is not yet over; and that
giants and ravishers are as common now, as in the time of
Charlemagne: a young woman of sense and spirit needs no other
protection; do not flatter the girl into affectation and imbecility. If
blank paper be your passion, you can be at no loss; the town will
supply quires and reams.'</p>

<p>'There I differ from you,' said the gentleman on the opposite side
of the table; 'to preserve the mind a blank, we must be both deaf and
blind, for, while any inlet to perception remains, your paper will
infallibly contract characters of some kind, or be blotted and
scrawled!'</p>

<p>'For God's sake! do not let us begin to philosophise,' retorted his
antagonist, who was not to be easily silenced.</p>

<p>'I agree with you,'&mdash;rejoined the other&mdash;'<i>thinking</i> is undoubtedly
very laborious, and <i>principle</i> equally troublesome and impertinent.'</p>

<p>I looked at him as he finished speaking, and caught his eye for a
moment; its expression methought was doubtful. The man of fashion
continued to expatiate in rhetorical periods&mdash;He informed us, that he
had fine feelings, but they never extended beyond selfish gratification.
For his part, he had as much humanity as any man, for which reason
he carefully avoided the scene or the tale of distress. He, likewise,
had his opinions, but their pliability rendered them convenient to
himself, and accommodating to his friends. He had courage to
sustain fatigue and hardship, when, not his country, but vanity
demanded the exertion. It was glorious to boast of having travelled
two hundred miles in eight and forty hours, and sat up three nights,
to be present, on two succeeding evenings, at a ball in distant
counties.</p>

<p>'This man,' I said to myself, while I regarded him with a look of
ineffable scorn&mdash;'takes a great deal of pains to render himself
ridiculous, he surely must have a vile heart, or a contemptible opinion
of mankind: if he be really the character he describes, he is a
compound of atrocity and folly, and a pest to the world; if he slanders
himself, what must be that state of society, the applause of which he
persuades himself is to be thus acquired?' I sighed deeply;&mdash;in either
case the reflection was melancholy;&mdash;my eyes enquired&mdash;'Am I to
hate or to despise you?' I know not whether he understood their
language, but he troubled me no more with his attentions.</p>

<p>I reflected a little too seriously:&mdash;I have since seen many a prating,
superficial coxcomb, who talks to display his oratory&mdash;<i>mere words</i>&mdash;repeated
by rote, to which few ideas are affixed, and which are
uttered and received with equal apathy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_VIII" id="ch_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p>During three years, I continued my weekly visits to Berkley square;
I was not always allowed to join the parties who assembled there,
neither indeed would it have been proper, for they were a motley
groupe; when permitted so to do, I collected materials for reflection.
I had been educated by my aunt, in strict principles of religion; many
of Mr Courtney's friends were men of wit and talents, who,
occasionally, discussed important subjects with freedom and ability: I
never ventured to mingle in the conversations, but I overcame my
timidity sufficiently to behave with propriety and composure; I
listened attentively to all that was said, and my curiosity was
awakened to philosophic enquiries.</p>

<p>Mr Courtney now entrusted me with the keys of the bookcases,
through which I ranged with ever new delight. I went through, by my
father's direction, a course of historical reading, but I could never
acquire a taste for this species of composition. Accounts of the early
periods of states and empires, of the Grecian and Roman republics, I
pursued with pleasure and enthusiasm: but when they became more
complicated, grew corrupt, luxurious, licentious, perfidious, mercenary,
I turned from them fatigued, and disgusted, and sought to
recreate my spirits in the fairer regions of poetry and fiction.</p>

<p>My early associations rendered theology an interesting subject to
me; I read ecclesiastical history, a detail of errors and crimes, and
entered deeply into polemic divinity: my mind began to be
emancipated, doubts had been suggested to it, I reasoned freely,
endeavoured to arrange and methodize my opinions, and to trace
them fearlessly through all their consequences: while from exercising
my thoughts with freedom, I seemed to acquire new strength and
dignity of character. I met with some of the writings of Descartes,
and was seized with a passion for metaphysical enquiries. I began to
think about the nature of the soul&mdash;whether it was a composition of
the elements, the result of organized matter, or a subtle and etherial
fire.</p>

<p>In the course of my researches, the Heloise of Rousseau fell into
my hands.&mdash;Ah! with what transport, with what enthusiasm, did I
peruse this dangerous, enchanting, work!&mdash;How shall I paint the
sensations that were excited in my mind!&mdash;the pleasure I experienced
approaches the limits of pain&mdash;it was tumult&mdash;all the ardour of my
character was excited.&mdash;Mr Courtney, one day, surprised me
weeping over the sorrows of the tender St Preux. He hastily snatched
the book from my hand, and, carefully collecting the remaining
volumes, carried them in silence to his chamber: but the impression
made on my mind was never to be effaced&mdash;it was even productive of
a long chain of consequences, that will continue to operate till the day
of my death.</p>

<p>My time at this period passed rapidly and pleasantly. My father
never treated me with affection; but the austerity of his manner
gradually subsided. He gave me, occasionally, useful hints and
instructions. Without feeling for him any tenderness, he inspired me
with a degree of respect. The library was a source of lively and
inexhaustible pleasure to my mind; and, when admitted to the table
of Mr Courtney, some new character or sentiment frequently
sharpened my attention, and afforded me subjects for future enquiry
and meditation. I delighted to expatiate, when returning to the kind
and hospitable mansion of my beloved aunt, (which I still considered
as my home) on the various topics which I had collected in my little
emigrations. I was listened to by my cousins with a pleasure that
flattered my vanity, and looked up to as a kind of superior being;&mdash;a
homage particularly gratifying to a young mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="ch_IX" id="ch_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>The excellent woman, who had been my more than mother, took
infinite pains to cure the foibles, which, like pernicious weeds,
entangled themselves with, and sometimes threatened to choak, the
embryo blossoms of my expanding mind. Ah! with what pleasure do I
recall her beloved idea to my memory! Fostered by her maternal
love, and guided by her mild reason, how placid, and how sweet,
were my early days!&mdash;Why, my first, my tenderest friend, did I lose
you at that critical period of life, when the harmless sports and
occupations of childhood gave place to the pursuits, the passions and
the errors of youth?&mdash;With the eloquence of affection, with gentle,
yet impressive persuasion, thou mightest have checked the wild
career of energetic feeling, which thou hast so often remarked with
hope and terror.</p>

<p>As I entered my eighteenth year, I lost, by a premature death, this
tender monitor. Never shall I forget her last emphatic, affectionate,
caution.</p>

<p>'Beware, my dear Emma,' said this revered friend, 'beware of
strengthening, by indulgence, those ardent and impetuous sensations,
which, while they promise vigour of mind, fill me with apprehension
for the virtue, for the happiness of my child. I wish not that the
canker-worm, Distrust, should blast the fair fruit of your ripening
virtues. The world contains many benevolent, many disinterested,
spirits; but civilization is yet distempered and imperfect; the
inequalities of society, by fostering artificial wants, and provoking
jealous competitions, have generated selfish and hostile passions.
Nature has been vainly provident for her offspring, while man, with
mistaken avidity, grasping more than he has powers to enjoy, preys on
his fellow man:&mdash;departing from simple virtues, and simple
pleasures, in their stead, by common consent, has a wretched
semblance been substituted. Endeavour to contract your wants, and
aspire only to a rational independence; by exercising your faculties,
still the importunate suggestions of your sensibility; preserve your
sincerity, cherish the ingenuous warmth of unsophisticated feeling,
but let discernment precede confidence. I tremble even for the excess
of those virtues which I have laboured to cultivate in your lively and
docile mind. If I could form a wish for longer life, it is only for my
children, and that I might be to my Emma instead of reason, till her
own stronger mind matures. I dread, lest the illusions of imagination
should render those powers, which would give force to truth and
virtue, the auxiliaries of passion. Learn to distinguish, with accuracy,
the good and ill qualities of those with whom you may mingle: while
you abhor the latter, separate the being from his errors; and while
you revere the former, the moment that your reverence becomes
personal, that moment, suspect that your judgment is in danger of
becoming the dupe of your affections.'</p>

<p>Would to God that I had impressed upon my mind&mdash;that I had
recalled to my remembrance more frequently&mdash;a lesson so important
to a disposition like mine!&mdash;a continual victim to the enthusiasm of
my feelings; incapable of approving, or disapproving, with moderation&mdash;the
most poignant sufferings, even the study of mankind, have been
insufficient to dissolve the powerful enchantment, to disentangle the
close-twisted associations!&mdash;But I check this train of overwhelming
reflection, that is every moment on the point of breaking the thread
of my narration, and obtruding itself to my pen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_X" id="ch_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p>Mr Courtney did not long survive the guardian of my infancy:&mdash;his
constitution had for some years been gradually impaired; and his
death was hastened by a continuance of habitual dissipation, which
he had not the resolution to relinquish, and to which his strength was
no longer equal. It was an event I had long anticipated, and which I
contemplated with a sensation of solemnity, rather than of grief. The
ties of blood are weak, if not the mere chimeras of prejudice, unless
sanctioned by reason, or cemented by habits of familiar and
affectionate intercourse. Mr Courtney refusing the title of father,
from a conviction that his conduct gave him no claim to this
endearing appellation, had accustomed me to feel for him only the
respect due to some talents and good qualities, which threw a veil
over his faults. Courage and truth were the principles with which he
endeavoured to inspire me;&mdash;precepts, which I gratefully acknowledge,
and which forbid me to adopt the language of affection, when
no responsive sympathies exist in the heart.</p>

<p>My eyes were yet moist with the tears that I had shed for the loss
of my maternal friend, when I received a hasty summons to Berkley-square.
A servant informed me, that his master was, at length, given
over by his physicians, and wished to speak to Miss Courtney, before
his strength and spirits were too much exhausted.</p>

<p>I neither felt, nor affected, surprize at this intelligence, but threw
myself, without reply, into the carriage which had been dispatched for
my conveyance.</p>

<p>On entering the house, a gloomy silence seemed to reign
throughout the late festive apartments; but, as I had seldom been a
partaker of the festivity, the contrast struck me less forcibly than it
might otherwise have done. My name was announced, and I was
conducted, by the housekeeper, to the chamber of her dying
master, who, supported on pillows, breathed with difficulty, but
appeared to be free from pain, and tolerably composed. I met the
physician in the ante-chamber; who, on my requesting earnestly to
know the situation of his patient, informed me&mdash;That an internal
mortification had taken place, and that he could not survive many
hours.</p>

<p>Approaching the bed, considerably shocked at the intelligence I
had received, Mr Courtney, in a low and faint voice, desired me to
draw a chair near him. I obeyed in silence.</p>

<p>'Emma,' said he, 'I am about to quit a world, in which I have
experienced little sincere enjoyment; yet, I leave it reluctantly. Had I
been more temperate in my pleasures, perhaps, they might have been
less destructive, and more protracted. I begin to suspect, that I have
made some great mistakes; but it is now too late for retraction, and I
will not, in my last moments, contradict, by my example, the lesson of
fortitude, with which it has been a part of my plan to inspire you. You
have now, unprotected, the world to encounter; for, I will frankly
confess, that my affection for you has not been strong enough to
induce me to forego my own more immediate gratification: but I have
never deceived you. Your mother, when she married, reserved for her
private expences a thousand pounds, which, on her deathbed, she
desired might be invested in the funds on your account. This request
I religiously complied with, and there it has remained untouched;
and, being purchased in your name, you may claim it whenever you
please. I have appointed you no guardians; for, already in your
nineteenth year and possessing an understanding superior to your sex
and age, I chose to leave you unfettered, and at your own discretion. I
spared from my pleasures what money was requisite to complete your
education; for having no fortune to give you, and my health being
precarious, I thought it just to afford you every advantage for the
improvement of those talents which you evidently possess, and which
must now enable you to make your way in the world; for the scanty
pittance, that the interest of your fortune will produce, is, I doubt,
insufficient for your support. Had I lived, it was my intention to have
established you by marriage; but that is a scheme, to which, at
present, I would not advise you to trust. Marriage, generally speaking,
in the existing state of things, must of necessity be an affair of <i>finance</i>.
My interest and introduction might have availed you something; but
mere merit, wit, or beauty, stand in need of more powerful
auxiliaries. My brother, Mr Morton<a name="fn_3r" id="fn_3r"></a><a href="#fn_3"><sup><span class="small">3</span></sup></a>, called on me this morning:&mdash;he
has agreed, for the present, to receive you into his family, where
you must endeavour to make yourself useful and agreeable, till you
can fix on a better and more independent plan. Finding me in so low
a state, your uncle would have waited a few days in town, to have seen the
result, and in case of the worst, to have taken you down with him, but
pressing business urged his departure. I would advise you, immediately
after my decease, to set out for Morton Park. Proper persons are
appointed to settle my affairs:&mdash;when every thing is turned into money,
there will, I trust, be sufficient to discharge my just debts; but do
not flatter yourself with the expectation of a surplus. Your presence
here, when I am no more, will be equally unnecessary and improper.'</p>

<p>This was said at intervals, and with difficulty; when, seeming quite
exhausted, he waved his hand for me to leave the room, and sunk
into a sort of dose, or rather stupor, which continued till within some
minutes of his decease.</p>

<p>Mr Courtney had been, what is called, a man of pleasure:&mdash;he had
passed thro' life without ever loving any one but himself&mdash;intent,
merely, on gratifying the humour of the moment. A superior education,
and an attentive observance, not of rational, but, of social man, in an
extensive commerce with the world, had sharpened his sagacity; but he
was inaccessible to those kindlings of the affections&mdash;those glowings of
admiration&mdash;inspired by real, or fancied, excellence, which never fail to
expand and advance the minds of such as are capable of sketching, with
a daring hand, the dangerous picture:&mdash;or of those philosophic and
comprehensive views, which teach us to seek a reflected happiness in
benevolent exertions for the welfare of others. My mother, I suspected,
had been the victim of her husband's unkindness and neglect: wonder
not, then, that my heart revolted when I would have given him the
tender appellation of father! If he coldly acknowledged any little merits
which I possessed, he regarded them rather with jealousy than
approbation; for he felt that they tacitly reproached him.</p>

<p>I will make no comment on the closing scene of his life. Among
the various emotions which had rapidly succeeded each other in my
mind, during his last address, surprize had no place; I had not then
his character to learn.</p>

<p class="small"><a name="fn_3" id="fn_3"></a><a href="#fn_3r">3:</a> Mr Courtney's brother had taken the name of Morton, to qualify himself for the
inheritance of an estate, bequeathed to him by a distant relation.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XI" id="ch_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>The small pittance bequeathed to me was insufficient to preserve me
from dependence.&mdash;<i>Dependence!</i>&mdash;I repeated to myself, and I felt my
heart die within me. I revolved in my mind various plans for my
future establishment.&mdash;I might, perhaps, be allowed to officiate, as an
assistant, in the school where I had been placed in my childhood,
with the mistress of which I still kept up an occasional correspondence;
but this was a species of servitude, and my mind panted for
freedom, for social intercourse, for scenes in motion, where the active
curiosity of my temper might find a scope wherein to range and
speculate. What could the interest of my little fortune afford? It
would neither enable me to live alone, nor even to board in a family
of any respectability. My beloved aunt was no more; her children
were about to be dispersed, and to form various connections.</p>

<p>Cruel prejudices!&mdash;I exclaimed&mdash;hapless woman! Why was I not
educated for commerce, for a profession, for labour? Why have I
been rendered feeble and delicate by bodily constraint, and fastidious
by artificial refinement? Why are we bound, by the habits of society,
as with an adamantine chain? Why do we suffer <ins title="original has ourselve">ourselves</ins> to be
confined within a magic circle, without daring, by a magnanimous
effort, to dissolve the barbarous spell?</p>

<p>A child in the drama of the world, I knew not which way to turn,
nor on what to determine. I wrote to Mr Morton, to enquire on what
terms I was to be received by his family. If merely as a visitor for a
few weeks, till I had time to digest my plans, I should meet, with
pleasure, a gentleman whose character I had been taught to respect;
but I should not consider myself as subject to controul. I ought,
perhaps, to have been satisfied with Mr Morton's answer to my
interrogatories.</p>

<p>He wished to embrace the daughter of his brother, his family
would be happy to render Morton Park agreeable to her, as long as
she should think proper to favour them by making it her residence.
The young ladies expected both pleasure and improvement from the
society of their accomplished kinswoman, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I believe I was unreasonable, the style of this letter was civil, nay
kind, and yet it appeared, to me, to want the vivifying principle&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;dictated merely by the head, it reached not the heart.</p>

<p>The trials of my mind, I foreboded, were about to commence, I
shrunk from the world I had been so willing to enter, for the rude
storms of which I had been little fitted by the fostering tenderness of
my early guardians. Those ardent feelings and lively expectations,
with all the glowing landscapes which my mind had sketched of the
varied pleasures of society, while in a measure secluded from its
enjoyments, gradually melted into one deep, undistinguished shade.
That sanguine ardour of temper, which had hitherto appeared the
predominant feature of my character, now gave place to despondency.
I wept, I suffered my tears to flow unrestrained: the solemnity
of the late events had seized my spirits, and the approaching change
filled me with solicitude. I wandered over the scenes of my past
pleasures, and recalled to my remembrance, with a sad and tender
luxury, a thousand little incidents, that derived all their importance
from the impossibility of their renewal. I gazed on every object, <i>for the
last time</i>&mdash;What is there in these words that awakens our fanaticisms?
I could have done homage to these inanimate, and, till now,
uninteresting objects; merely because I should <i>see them no more</i>.</p>

<p>How fantastic and how capricious are these sentiments! Ought I,
or ought I not, to blush while I acknowledge them? My young friends,
also, from whom I was about to separate myself!&mdash;how various might
be our destinies, and how unconscious were we of the future! Happy
ignorance, that by bringing the evils of life in succession, gradually
inures us to their endurance.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XII" id="ch_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>The hour at length came, when, harrassed in body and in mind, I set
out for Morton Park. I travelled alone, and reached the end of my
journey at close of day. I entreated Mr Morton, who hastened to
hand me from the carriage, and welcome my arrival, that I might be
permitted to retire to my apartment, pleading fatigue, and wishing to
wave the ceremony of an introduction to the family till the next
morning. My request was obligingly granted, and a servant ordered to
attend me to my chamber.</p>

<p>Many years had elapsed since I had seen this family, and my
judgment was then so immature, that our meeting at the breakfast
table had with each of us, I believe, the force of a first impression.
You know my <i>fanaticism</i> on these occasions. I will attempt an
imperfect sketch of the groupe, assembled in the saloon, to whom I
was severally presented on my entrance, by the lord of the domain.
Mr Morton, himself, to whom precedence is due, seemed to be about
fifty years of age, was of the middle stature, his features regular, and
his countenance placid: he spoke but little, but that little was always
mild and often judicious. He appeared not to be void of benevolent
affections, and had the character of a humane landlord, but his
virtues were, in a great measure, sunk in an habitual indolence of
temper; he would sometimes sacrifice his principles to his repose,
though never to his interest. His lady&mdash;no, I will not describe her;
her character will, it may be, unfold itself to you in future&mdash;Suffice it
to say, that her person was gross, her voice loud and discordant, and
her features rugged: she affected an air of openness and pleasantry; It
may be prejudiced, perhaps she did not <i>affect it</i>. Sarah Morton, the
eldest of the daughters, was about my age, she was under the middle
height, fair, plump, loquacious; there was a childish levity in her
accent and manners, which impressed strangers with an unfavourable
opinion of her understanding, but it was an acquired manner, for she
was shrewd and sensible. Ann, the second daughter was a little lively
brunette, with sharp features and sparkling black eyes; volatile, giddy,
vain and thoughtless, but good humoured and pretty. The other
children were much younger.</p>

<p>Two gentlemen joined us at our repast, visitors at Morton park.
Mr Francis, the elder, was in his fortieth year, his figure slender and
delicate, his eye piercing, and his manner impressive. It occurred to
me, that I had somewhere seen him before, and, after a few minutes
recollection, I recognized in him a gentleman who had occasionally
visited at my father's, and whom I have already mentioned as the
antagonist of the man of fashion, whose sentiments and volubility
excited my youthful astonishment and indignation. Mr Montague the
younger, the son of a medical gentleman residing in a neighbouring
county, seemed about one and twenty, tall, elegantly formed, full of
fire and vivacity, with imperious manners, an impetuous temper, and
stubborn prejudices.</p>

<p>The introduction of a stranger generally throws some kind of
restraint over a company; a break is made in their usual topics and
associations, till the disposition and habits of the intruder have, in
some degree, unfolded themselves. Mrs Morton took upon herself to
entertain; she exhibited her talents on various subjects, with apparent
self-approbation, till a few keen remarks from Mr Francis arrested
the torrent of her eloquence. The young ladies scrutinized me with
attention; even the lively Ann, while she minutely observed me, ceased
to court play from Mr Montague, who attended to me with the air,
and addressed me in the language of gallantry. I sometimes caught
the penetrating eye of Mr Francis, and his glance seemed to search
the soul.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Mr Morton having retired to his dressing-room,
and the younger part of the company strolling into the pleasure
grounds, whither I declined accompanying them, I took an
opportunity, being ever desirous of active and useful employment, of
offering my assistance to Mrs Morton, in the education of her
younger children; proposing to instruct them in the rudiments either
of music, drawing, French, or any other accomplishment, for which
my own education had capacitated me. Mr Francis remained
standing in a window, his back towards us, with a book in his hand,
on which he seemed intent.</p>

<p>'If,' replied Mrs Morton, 'it is your wish, Miss Courtney, to
procure the situation of governess in any gentleman's family, and it is
certainly a very laudable desire in a young woman of your <i>small
fortune</i>, Mr Morton will, I have no doubt, have it in his power to
recommend you: but in the education of my family, I desire no
interference; it is an important task, and I have my peculiar notions
on the subject: their expectations are not great, and your <i>elegant</i>
accomplishments might unfit them for their future, probable,
stations.'</p>

<p>The manner in which this speech was uttered spoke yet more
forcibly than the words.&mdash;I felt my cheeks glow.</p>

<p>'I was not asking favours, Madam, I was only desirous of being
useful.'</p>

<p>'It is a pity, then, that your discernment had not corrected your
vanity.'</p>

<p>The housekeeper entering, to consult her mistress on some
domestic occasion, Mrs Morton quitted the room. Mr Francis closed
his book, turned round, and gazed earnestly in my face: before
sufficiently mortified, his observation, which I felt at this moment
oppressive, did not relieve me. I attempted to escape, but, seizing my
hand, he detained me by a kind of gentle violence.</p>

<p>'And why this confusion, my dear Miss Courtney; do you blush for
having acted with propriety and spirit?' I burst into tears&mdash;I could not
help it&mdash;'How weak is this, how unworthy of the good sense you have
just manifested.'</p>

<p>'I confess it, but I feel myself, at this moment, a poor, a friendless,
an unprotected being.'</p>

<p>'What prejudices! poverty is neither criminal, nor disgraceful; you
will not want friends, while you continue to deserve them; and as for
protection,' (and he smiled) 'I had not expected from Emma
Courtney's spirited letter to Mr Morton, and equally proper retort to
his lady's impertinence, so plaintive, so feminine a complaint.&mdash;You
have talents, cultivate them, and learn to rest on your own powers.'</p>

<p>'I thank you for your reproof, and solicit your future lessons.'</p>

<p>'Can you bear the truth?'</p>

<p>'Try me.'</p>

<p>'Have you not cherished a false pride?'</p>

<p>It is too true, thought I, and I sighed.</p>

<p>'How shall I cure this foible?'</p>

<p>'By self-examination, by resolution, and perseverance.'</p>

<p>'Be to me instead of a conscience.'</p>

<p>'What, then, is become of your own?'</p>

<p>'Prejudice, I doubt, has blinded and warped it.'</p>

<p>'I suspect so; but you have energy and candor, and are not, I hope,
of a temper to despond.'</p>

<p>The return of the family terminated this singular conversation.
The young ladies rallied me, on being found <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the
philosopher; Mr Montague, I thought looked displeased. I stole out;
while the party were dressing for dinner, and rambled into the
gardens, which were extensive, and laid out with taste.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XIII" id="ch_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p>I judged my visit here would not be very long. I scarcely knew
whether I was most inclined to like or to fear Mr Francis, but I
determined, if possible, to cultivate his friendship. I interrogated
myself again and again&mdash;From whence this restlessness, this languor,
this disgust, with all I hear and see?&mdash;Why do I feel wayward,
querulous, fastidious? Mr Morton's family had no hearts; they
appeared to want a <i>sense</i>, that preyed incessantly on mine; I could not
love them, and my heart panted to expand its sensations.</p>

<p>Sarah and Ann became jealous of me, and of each other; the
haughty, yet susceptible, Montague addressed each in turn, with a
homage equally fervent for the moment, and equally transient. This
young man was bold, ardent, romantic, and enterprizing, but blown
about by every gust of passion, he appeared each succeeding moment
a different character: with a glowing and rapid imagination, he had
never given himself time to reason, to compare, to acquire principles:
following the bent of a raised, yet capricious fancy, he was ever in
pursuit of meteors, that led him into mischief, or phantoms, that
dissolved at his approach.</p>

<p>Had my mind been more assured and at ease, I could have amused
myself with the whimsical flights of this eccentric being&mdash;One hour,
attracted by the sportive graces of Ann, he played with and caressed
her, while the minutes flew rapidly on the light wing of amusement,
and, till reminded by the grave countenance of Mr Morton, seemed
to forget that any other person was present. The next minute,
disgusted by her frivolity, all his attention was absorbed by the less
fascinating, but more artful and ingenious, Sarah. Then, quitting
them both, he would pursue my steps, break in upon my meditations,
and haunt my retreats, from whence, when not disposed to be
entertained by his caprice, I found it not difficult to drive him, by
attacking some of his various prejudices:&mdash;accustomed to feel, and
not to reason, his tastes and opinions were vehement and
uncontroulable.</p>

<p>From this society, so uncongenial to my reflecting, reasoning,
mind, I found some resource in the conversation of Mr Francis. The
pride of Montague was evidently piqued by the decided preference
which I gave to the company of his friend; but his homage, or his
resentment, were alike indifferent to me: accustomed to speak and
act from my convictions, I was but little solicitous respecting the
opinion of others. My understanding was exercised by attending to
the observations of Mr Francis, and by discussing the questions to
which they led; yet it was exercised without being gratified: he
opposed and bewildered me, convicted me of error, and harrassed
me with doubt.</p>

<p>Mr Francis soon after prepared to return to town. I was affected at
the idea of his departure; and felt, that in losing his society, I should
be deprived of my only rational recreation, and should again be
exposed to Mrs Morton's illiberal attacks, who appeared to have
marked me out for her victim, though at present restrained by the
presence of a man, who had found means to inspire, even her, with
some degree of respect.</p>

<p>Mr Francis, on the evening preceding the day on which he
purposed leaving Morton Park, passing under the open window of my
chamber, in which I was sitting with a book to enjoy the refreshing
breeze, invited me to come down, and accompany him in a ramble. I
immediately complied with his request, and joined him in a few
minutes, with a countenance clouded with regret at the idea of his
quitting us.</p>

<p>'You are going,' said I, as I gave him my hand (which he passed
under his arm), 'and I lose my friend and counsellor.'</p>

<p>'Your concern is obliging; but you are capable of standing alone,
and your mind, by so doing, will acquire strength.'</p>

<p>'I feel as if this would not be the case: the world appears to me a
thorny and pathless wilderness; I step with caution, and look around
me with dread.&mdash;That I require protection and assistance is, I
confess, a proof of weakness, but it is nevertheless true.'</p>

<p>'Mr Montague,' replied he, with some degree of archness in his
tone and manner, 'is a gallant knight, a pattern of chivalry, and appears
to be particularly calculated for the defender of distressed damsels!'</p>

<p>'I have no inclination to trust myself to the guidance of one, who
seems himself entangled in an inextricable maze of error, and whose
versatile character affords little basis for confidence.'</p>

<p>'Tell me what it is you fear;&mdash;are your apprehensions founded in
reason?'</p>

<p>'Recollect my youth, my sex, and my precarious situation.'</p>

<p>'I thought you contemned the plea of <i>sex</i>, as a sanction for
weakness!'</p>

<p>'Though I disallow it as a natural, I admit it as an artificial, plea.'</p>

<p>'Explain yourself.'</p>

<p>'The character, you tell me, is modified by circumstances: the
customs of society, then, have enslaved, enervated, and degraded
woman.'</p>

<p>'I understand you: there is truth in your remark, though you have
given it undue force.'</p>

<p>I hesitated&mdash;my heart was full&mdash;I felt as if there were many things
which I wished to say; but, however paradoxical, the manners of Mr
Francis repressed, while they invited, confidence. I respected his
reason, but I doubted whether I could inspire him with sympathy, or
make him fully comprehend my feelings. I conceived I could express
myself with more freedom on paper; but I had not courage to request
a correspondence, when he was silent on the subject. That it would
be a source of improvement to me, I could not doubt, but prejudice
with-held me from making the proposal. He looked at me, and
perceived my mind struggling with a suggestion, to which it dared not
give utterance: he suspected the truth, but was unwilling to disturb
the operations of my understanding. We walked for some time in
silence:&mdash;my companion struck into a path that led towards the
house&mdash;listened to the village clock as it struck nine&mdash;and observed,
the hour grew late. He had distinguished me, and I was flattered by
that distinction; he had supported me against the arrogance of Mrs
Morton, retorted the sly sarcasms of Sarah, and even helped to keep
the impetuous Montague in awe, and obliged him to rein in his
offensive spirit, every moment on the brink of outrage. My heart,
formed for grateful attachment, taking, in one instant, a hasty
retrospect of the past, and a rapid glance into futurity, experienced at
that moment so desolating a pang, that I endeavoured in vain to
repress its sensations, and burst into a flood of tears. Mr Francis
suddenly stopped, appeared moved, and, with a benevolent aspect
and soothing accents, enquired into the cause of an emotion so
sudden and unexpected. I wept a few minutes in silence, and my
spirits seemed, in some measure, relieved.</p>

<p>'I weep,' (said I), 'because I am <i>friendless</i>; to be esteemed and
cherished is necessary to my existence; I am an alien in the family
where I at present reside, I cannot remain here much longer, and to
whom, and whither, shall I go?'</p>

<p>He took my hand&mdash;'I will not, at present, say all that it might be
proper to say, because I perceive your mind is in a feeble state;&mdash;My
affairs call me to London;&mdash;yet, there is a method of conversing at a
distance.'</p>

<p>I eagerly availed myself of this suggestion, which I had wished,
without having the courage to propose.</p>

<p>'Will you, then, allow me, through the medium of pen and paper,
to address, to consult you, as I may see occasion?'</p>

<p>'Will I? yes, most cheerfully! Propose your doubts and state your
difficulties, and we shall see,' (smiling) 'whether they admit of a
solution.'</p>

<p>Thanking him, I engaged to avail myself of this permission, and we
proceeded slowly to the house, and joined the party in the supper
room. I never once thought of my red and swoln eyes, till Sarah,
glancing a look half curious, half sarcastic, towards me, exclaimed
from Shakespear, in an affected tone,</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">'Parting is such sweet sorrow!'
</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Francis looked at her sternly, she blushed and was silent; Mr
Montague was captious; Ann mortified, that she could not by her
little tricks gain his attention. Mrs Morton sat wrapped in mock
dignity; while Mr Morton, and his philosophic friend, canvassed the
principles upon which an horizontal mill was about to be constructed
on the estate of the former. After a short and scanty meal, I retired to
my apartment, determined to rise early the next morning, and make
breakfast for my friend before his departure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XIV" id="ch_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p>Mr Francis had ordered his horse to be ready at five o'clock. I left
my chamber at four, to have the pleasure of preparing for him the last
friendly repast, and of saying <i>farewel</i>. He was serene and chearful as
usual, I somewhat more pensive; we parted with great cordiality, he
gave me his address in town, and engaged me to write to him shortly.
I accompanied him through the Park to the porter's lodge, where the
servant and horses waited his coming. My eyes glistened as I bade
him adieu, and reiterated my wishes for his safety and prosperity,
while his features softened into a more than usual benignity, as he
returned my salutation.</p>

<p>I wandered thoughtfully back towards the house, but the rich
purple that began to illumine the east, the harbinger of the rising sun,
the freshness of the morning air, the soft dews which already glittered
on every fragrant plant and flower, the solemn stillness, so grateful to
the reflecting mind, that pervaded the scene, induced me to prolong
my walk. Every object appeared in unison with my feelings, my heart
swelled with devotional affections, it aspired to the Author of nature.
After having bewildered ourselves amid systems and theories,
religion, in such situations, returns to the susceptible mind as a
<i>sentiment</i> rather than as a principle. A passing cloud let fall a gentle,
drizzling shower; sheltered beneath the leafy umbrage of a spreading
oak, I rather heard than felt it; yet, the coolness it diffused seemed to
quench those ardent emotions, which are but too congenial with my
disposition, while the tumult of the passions subsided into a delicious
tranquillity.</p>

<p>How mutable are human beings!&mdash;A very few hours converted this
sublime complacency into perturbation and tumult. Having extended
my walk beyond its accustomed limits, on my return, I retired,
somewhat fatigued to my apartment, and devoted the morning to my
studies. At the dinner hour I joined the family, each individual of
which seemed wrapped up in reserve, scarcely deigning to practise
the common ceremonies of the occasion. I was not sufficiently
interested in the cause of these appearances to make any enquiries,
and willingly resigned myself, in the intervals of the entertainment, to
meditation.</p>

<p>When the table was cleared, and the servants had withdrawn,
perceiving the party not sociably inclined, I was about to retire&mdash;when
Mrs Morton observed, with features full of a meaning which I
did not comprehend, that&mdash;</p>

<p>'Their guest, Mr Francis, had, no doubt, left Morton Park
gratefully impressed by the <i>kindness</i> of Miss Courtney.'</p>

<p>Montague reddened&mdash;bit his lips&mdash;got up&mdash;and sat down again.
The young ladies wore an air not perfectly good-humoured, and a
little triumphant. Mr Morton looked very solemn.</p>

<p>'I hope so, Madam,' I replied, somewhat carelessly. 'I felt myself
indebted to Mr Francis for his civilities, and was solicitous to make
him all the return in my power&mdash;I wish that power had been
enlarged.'</p>

<p>She held up her hands and eyes with an affected, and ridiculous,
gesture.</p>

<p>'Mr Francis,' said Montague, abruptly, 'is very happy in having
inspired you with sentiments <i>so partial</i>.'</p>

<p>'I am not partial&mdash;I am merely just. Mr Francis appeared to me a
rational man, and my understanding was exercised and gratified by
his <ins title="original has covnersation">conversation</ins>.'</p>

<p>I was about to proceed, but my uncle (who seemed to have been
tutored for the occasion) interrupted me with much gravity.</p>

<p>'You are but little acquainted, Emma, with the customs of society;
there is great indecorum in a young lady's making these distinctions.'</p>

<p>'What distinctions, my dear Sir!&mdash;in prefering a reasonable man to
fools and coxcombs.'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, my dear&mdash;you have a quick wit, but you want
experience. I am informed, that you breakfasted with Mr Francis this
morning, and attended him through the Park:&mdash;this, with your late
walk yesterday evening, and evident emotion on your return, let me
tell you, child, wears an indecorous appearance:&mdash;the world is justly
attentive to the conduct of young women, and too apt to be
censorious.'</p>

<p>I looked round me with unaffected surprize&mdash;'Good God!&mdash;did I
suppose, in this family, it was necessary to be upon my guard against
malicious constructions?'</p>

<p>'Pray,'&mdash;interrupted Sarah, pertly&mdash;'would you not have expressed
some surprize, had I shewed Mr Montague similar attentions?'</p>

<p>I looked at her, I believe, a little too contemptuously.&mdash;'Whatever
sentiments might have been excited in my mind by the attentions of
Miss Morton to Mr Montague, <i>surprize</i>, assuredly, would not have
been among them.'</p>

<p>She coloured, and Montague's passions began to rise. I stopped
him at the beginning of an impertinent harangue, by observing&mdash;</p>

<p>'That I did not think myself accountable to him for my conduct;&mdash;before
I should be solicitous respecting his opinions, he must give me
better reasons, than he had hitherto done, to respect his judgment.'</p>

<p>Ann wept, and prattled something, to which nobody thought it
worth while to attend.</p>

<p>'Well, Sir,' continued I, turning to Mr Morton, 'be pleased to give
me, in detail, what you have to alledge, that I may be enabled to
justify myself.'</p>

<p>'Will you allow me to ask you a question?'</p>

<p>'Most certainly.'</p>

<p>'Has Mr Francis engaged you to correspond with him?'</p>

<p>I was silent a few moments.</p>

<p>'You hesitate!'</p>

<p>'Only, Sir, <i>how</i> to answer your question.&mdash;I certainly intend myself
the pleasure of addressing Mr Francis on paper; but I cannot strictly
say <i>he engaged</i> me so to do, as it was a proposal he was led to make, by
conjecturing my wishes on the subject.'</p>

<p>Again, Mrs Morton, with uplifted hands and eyes&mdash;'What
effrontery!'</p>

<p>I seemed not to hear her.&mdash;'Have you any thing more to say, my
dear uncle?'</p>

<p>'You are a strange girl. It would not, perhaps, be proper before this
company to enquire'&mdash;and he stopped.</p>

<p>'Any thing is proper, Sir, to enquire of me, and in any company&mdash;I
have no reserves, no secrets.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, I think it necessary to inform you, that, though a
sensible, well educated, liberal-minded, man, Mr Francis has neither
estate nor fortune, nor does he practise any lucrative profession.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry for it, on his own account; and for those whom his
generosity might benefit. But, what is it to me?'</p>

<p>'You affect to misunderstand me.'</p>

<p>'I <i>affect</i> nothing.'</p>

<p>'I will speak more plainly:&mdash;Has he made you any proposals?'</p>

<p>The purport of this solemn, but ludicrous, preparation, at once
flashed upon my mind, the first time the thought had ever occurred. I
laughed&mdash;I could not help it.</p>

<p>'I considered Mr Francis as a <i>philosopher</i>, and not as a <i>lover</i>. Does
this satisfy you, Sir?'</p>

<p>My uncle's features, in spite of himself, relaxed into a half-smile.</p>

<p>'Very platonic&mdash;sweet simplicity!'&mdash;drauled out Mrs Morton, in
ironical accents.</p>

<p>'I will not be insulted, Mr Morton!' quitting my seat, and rising in
temper.&mdash;'I consider myself, merely, as your visitant, and not as
responsible to any one for my actions. Conscious of purity of
intention, and superior to all disguise or evasion, I was not aware of
these feminine, indelicate, unfriendly suggestions. If this behaviour
be a specimen of what I am to expect in the world&mdash;the world may do
its will&mdash;but I will never be its slave: while I have strength of mind to
form principles, and courage to act upon them, I am determined to
preserve my freedom, and trust to the general candour and good
sense of mankind to appreciate me justly. As the brother of my late
father, and as entitled to respect from your own kind intentions, I am
willing to enter into any explanations, which <i>you</i>, <i>Sir</i>, may think
necessary:&mdash;neither my motives, nor my actions, have ever yet shrunk
from investigation. Will you permit me to attend you in your library?
It is not my intention to intrude longer on your hospitality, and I
could wish to avail myself of your experience and counsels respecting
my future destination.'</p>

<p>Mr Morton, at my request, withdrew with me into the library,
where I quickly removed from his mind those injurious suspicions
with which Mrs Morton had laboured to inspire him. He would not
hear of my removal from the Park&mdash;apologized for what had passed&mdash;assured
me of his friendship and protection&mdash;and entreated me to
consider his house as my home. There was an honest warmth and
sincerity in his manner, that sensibly affected me; I could have wept;
and I engaged, at his repeated <ins title="original has requst">request</ins>, not to think, at present, of
withdrawing myself from his protection. Thus we separated.</p>

<p>How were the virtues of this really good man tarnished by an
unsuitable connection! In the giddy hours of youth, we thoughtlessly
rush into engagements, that fetter our minds, and affect our future
characters, without reflecting on the important consequences of our
conduct. This is a subject on which I have had occasion to reflect
deeply; yet, alas! my own boasted reason has been, but too often, the
dupe of my imagination.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XV" id="ch_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p>Nothing, here, occupied my heart&mdash;a heart to which it was
necessary to love and admire. I had suffered myself to be irritated&mdash;the
tumult of my spirits did not easily subside&mdash;I was mortified at the
reflection&mdash;I had believed myself armed with patience and fortitude,
but my philosophy was swept before the impetuous emotions of my
passions like chaff before the whirlwind. I took up my pen to calm my
spirits, and addressed myself to the man who had been, unconsciously,
the occasion of these vexations.&mdash;My swelling heart needed
the relief of communication.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO MR FRANCIS</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>'I Sought earnestly for the privilege of addressing you on
paper. My mind seemed to overflow with a thousand sentiments,
that I had not the courage to express in words; but now, when the
period is arrived, that I can take up my pen, unawed by your
penetrating glance, unchecked by your poignant reply, and pour
out my spirit before you, I feel as if its emotions were too wayward,
too visionary, too contradictory, to merit your attention.</p>

<p>'Every thing I see and hear is a disappointment to me:&mdash;brought
up in retirement&mdash;conversing only with books&mdash;dwelling with
ardour on the great characters, and heroic actions, of antiquity, all
my ideas of honour and distinction were associated with those of
virtue and talents. I conceived, that the pursuit of truth, and the
advancement of reason, were the grand objects of universal
attention, and I panted to do homage to those superior minds, who,
teaching mankind to be wise, would at length lead them to
happiness. Accustomed to think, to feel, to kindle into action, I am
at a loss to understand the distinction between theory and practice,
which every one seems eager to inculcate, as if the degrading and
melancholy intelligence, <ins title="original has with">which</ins> fills my soul with despondency, and
pervades my understanding with gloom, was to them a subject of
exultation.</p>

<p>'Is virtue, then, a chimera&mdash;does it exist only in the regions of
romance?&mdash;Have we any interest in finding our fellow creatures
weak and miserable?&mdash;Is the Being who formed them unjust,
capricious, impotent, or tyrannical?</p>

<p>'Answer these questions, that press heavily on my mind, that
dart across it, in its brightest moments, clouding its sun-shine with
a thick and impenetrable darkness. Must the benevolent emotions,
which I have hitherto delighted to cherish, turn into misanthropy&mdash;must
the fervent and social affections of my heart give place to
inanity, to apathy&mdash;must the <ins title="original has acitivity">activity</ins> of a curious and vigorous
mind sink into torpor and abhorred vacuity?</p>

<p>'While they teach me to distrust the existence of virtue, they
endeavour to impose on me, in its stead, a fictitious semblance;
and to substitute, for the pure gold of truth, a paltry tinsel. It is in
vain I ask&mdash;what have those to do with "<i>seeming</i>," who still retain
"that which <i>passeth shew</i>?" However my actions may be corrupted
by the contagious example of the world, may I still hold fast my
integrity, and disdain to wear the <i>appearance</i> of virtue, when the
substance shall no longer exist.</p>

<p>'To admire, to esteem, to love, are congenial to my nature&mdash;I
am unhappy, because these affections are not called into exercise.
To venerate abstract perfection, requires too vigorous an exertion
of the mental powers&mdash;I would see virtue exemplified, I would love
it in my fellow creatures&mdash;I would catch the glorious enthusiasm,
and rise from created to uncreated excellence.</p>

<p>'I am perplexed with doubts; relieve the wanderings of my mind,
solve the difficulties by which it is agitated, prepare me for the
world which is before me. The prospect, no longer beaming with
light, no longer glowing with a thousand vivid hues, is overspread
with mists, which the mind's eye vainly attempts to penetrate. I
would feel, again, the value of existence, the worth of rectitude, the
certainty of truth, the blessing of hope! Ah! tell me not&mdash;that the
gay expectations of youth have been the meteors of fancy, the
visions of a romantic and distempered imagination! If I must not
live to realize them, I would not live at all.</p>

<p>'My harrassed mind turns to you! You will not ridicule its
scruples&mdash;you will, at least, deign to reason with me, and, in the
exercise of my understanding, I shall experience a temporary <ins title="original has reflief">relief</ins>
from the sensations which devour me, the suspicions that distress
me, and which spread over futurity a fearful veil.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I walked to the next market town, and left my letter at the post-house,&mdash;I
waited impatiently for a reply; my mind wanted <i>impression</i>,
and sunk into languor. The answer, which arrived in a few days, was
kind, because it was prompt, my sickly mind required a speedy
remedy.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
TO EMMA COURTNEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'Why will you thus take things in masses, and continually dwell
in extremes? You deceive yourself; instead of cultivating your
reason, you are fostering an excessive sensibility, a fastidious
delicacy. It is the business of reason to compare, to separate, to
discriminate. Is there no medium&mdash;extraordinary exertions are
only called forth by extraordinary contingences;&mdash;because every
human being is not a hero, are we then to distrust the existence of
virtue?</p>

<p>'The mind is modified by the circumstances in which it is
placed, by the accidents of birth and education; the constitutions of
society are all, as yet, imperfect; they have generated, and
perpetuated, many mistakes&mdash;the consequences of those mistakes
will, eventually, carry with them their antidote, the seeds of
reproduction are, even, visible in their decay. The growth of reason
is slow, but not the less sure; the increase of knowledge must
necessarily prepare the way for the increase of virtue and
happiness.</p>

<p>'Look back upon the early periods of society, and, taking a
retrospective view of what has been done, amidst the interruptions
of barbarous inroads, falling empires, and palsying despotism,
calculate what yet may be achieved: while the causes, which have
hitherto impeded the progress of civilization, must continue to
decrease, in an accelerated ration, with the wide, and still wider,
diffusion of truth.</p>

<p>'We may trace most of the faults, and the miseries of mankind,
to the vices and errors of political institutions, their permanency
having been their radical defect. Like children, we have dreamt,
that what gratifies our desires, or contributes to our convenience,
to-day, will prove equally useful and satisfactory to-morrow,
without reflecting on the growth of the body, the change of
humours, the new objects, and the new situations, which every
succeeding hour brings in its train. That immutability, which
constitutes the perfection of what we (from the poverty of
language) term the <i>divine mind</i>, would inevitably be the bane of
creatures liable to error; it is of the constancy, rather than of the
fickleness, of human beings, that we have reason to complain.</p>

<p>'Every improvement must be the result of successive experiments,
this has been found true in natural science, and it must be
universally applied to be universally beneficial. Bigotry, whether
religious, political, moral, or commercial, is the canker-worm at the
root of the tree of knowledge and of virtue. The wildest
speculations are less mischievous than the torpid state of error: he,
who tamely resigns his understanding to the guidance of another,
sinks at once, from the dignity of a rational being, to a mechanical
puppet, moved at pleasure on the wires of the artful operator.&mdash;<i>Imposition</i>
is the principle and support of every varied description
of tyranny, whether civil or ecclesiastical, moral or mental; its
baneful consequence is to degrade both him who is imposed on,
and him who imposes. <i>Obedience</i>, is a word, which ought never to
have had existence: as we recede from conviction, and languidly
resign ourselves to any foreign authority, we quench the principle
of action, of virtue, of reason;&mdash;we bear about the semblance of
humanity, but the spirit is fled.</p>

<p>'These are truths, which will slowly, but ultimately, prevail;
in the splendour of which, the whole fabric of superstition will
gradually fade and melt away. The world, like every individual, has
its progress from infancy to maturity&mdash;How many follies do we
commit in childhood? how many errors are we precipitated into by
the fervour and inexperience of youth! Is not every stable principle
acquired through innumerable mistakes&mdash;can you wonder, that in
society, amidst the aggregate of jarring interests and passions,
reformation is so tardy? Though civilization has been impeded by
innumerable obstacles, even these help to carry on the great work:
empires may be overturned, and the arts scattered, but not lost.
The hordes of barbarians, which overwhelmed ancient Rome,
adopted at length the religion, the laws, and the improvements of
the vanquished, as Rome had before done those of Greece. As the
stone, which, thrown into the water, spreads circles still more and
more extended;&mdash;or (to adopt the gospel similitude) as the grain of
mustard seed, growing up into a large tree, shelters the fowls of
heaven in its branches&mdash;so will knowledge, at length, diffuse itself,
till it covers the whole earth.</p>

<p>'When the minds of men are changed, the system of things will
also change; but these changes, though active and incessant, must
be gradual. Reason will fall softly, and almost imperceptibly, like a
gentle shower of dews, fructifying the soil, and preparing it for
future harvests. Let us not resemble the ambitious shepherd, who,
calling for the accumulated waters of the Nile upon his lands, was,
with his flock, swept away in the impetuous torrent.</p>

<p>'You ask, whether&mdash;because human beings are still imperfect&mdash;you
are to resign your benevolence, and to cherish misanthropy?
What a question! Would you hate the inhabitants of an hospital for
being infected with a pestilential disorder? Let us remember, that
vice originates in mistakes of the understanding, and that, he who
seeks happiness by means contradictory and destructive, <i>is
emphatically the sinner</i>. Our duties, then, are obvious&mdash;If selfish and
violent passions have been generated by the inequalities of society,
we must labour to counteract them, by endeavouring to combat
prejudice, to expand the mind, to give comprehensive views, to
teach mankind their true interest, and to lead them to habits of
goodness and greatness. Every prejudice conquered, every mistake
rectified, every individual improved, is an advance upon the great
scale of virtue and happiness.</p>

<p>'Let it, then, be your noblest ambition to co-operate with, to join
your efforts, to those of philosophers and sages, the benefactors of
mankind. To waste our time in useless repinings is equally weak
and vain; every one in his sphere may do something; each has a
little circle where his influence will be availing. Correct your own
errors, which are various&mdash;weeds in a luxuriant soil&mdash;and you will
have done something towards the general reformation. But you are
able to do more;&mdash;be vigilant, be active, beware of the illusions of
fancy! I suspect, that you will have much to suffer&mdash;may you, at
length, reap the fruits of a wholesome, though it should be a bitter,
experience.</p>

<p>I perused the letter, I had received, again and again; it awakened a
train of interesting reflections, and my spirits became tranquillized.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XVI" id="ch_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p>Early one fine morning, Ann tapped gently at the door of my
chamber; I had already risen, and invited her to enter.</p>

<p>'Would I accompany her to breakfast, with a widow lady, who
resided in a village about two miles from Morton Park, an occasional
visitant in the family, a lady with whom, she was certain, I should be
charmed.'</p>

<p>I smiled at her ardour, thanked her for her kindness, and readily
agreed to her proposal. We strolled together through an adjacent
wood, which, by a shady and winding path, conducted us towards the
residence of this vaunted favourite of my little companion.</p>

<p>On our way, she entertained me with a slight sketch of the history
of Mrs Harley and her family. She was the widow of a merchant, who
was supposed to possess great property; but, practising occasionally
as an underwriter, a considerable capture by the enemy (during war
time) of some rich ships, reduced his fortune; and, by the consequent
anxiety, completely destroyed a before debilitated constitution. He
died in a few weeks after the confirmation of his loss, and, having
neglected to make a will, a freehold estate of some value, which was
all that remained of his effects, devolved of course to his eldest son;
his two younger sons and three daughters being left wholly
unprovided for. Augustus Harley, the heir, immediately sold the
estate, and divided the produce, in equal shares, between each
individual of the family. His brothers had been educated for
commerce, and were enabled, through the generous kindness of
Augustus, to carry on, with advantage and reputation, their respective
occupations; the sisters were, soon after, eligibly married. Augustus,
who had been educated for the law, disgusted with its chicanery,
relinquished the profession, content to restrain his expences within
the limits of a narrow income. This income had since received an
increase, by the bequest of a distant relation, a man of a whimsical
character, who had married, early in life, a beautiful woman, for love;
but his wife having eloped from him with an officer, and, in the
course of the intrigue, practised a variety of deceptions, he had
retired disgusted from society, cherishing a misanthropical spirit:
and, on his decease, bequeathed an annual sum of four hundred
pounds to Augustus Harley (to whom in his childhood he had been
particularly attached) on condition of his remaining unmarried. On
his marriage, or death, this legacy passed into another branch of the
family. On this acquisition Augustus determined on making the tour
of Europe; and, after travelling on the continent for three years, on
his return to his native country, alternately resided, either in the
village of<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, with his mother, or in the metropolis, where he
divided his time, between liberal studies, and rational recreation. His
visits to the country had, of late, been shorter and less frequent: he
was the idol of his mother, and universally respected by his
acquaintance, for his noble and generous conduct.&mdash;'Ah!' (added the
lively narrator) 'could you but see Augustus Harley, you would,
infallibly, lose your heart&mdash;so frank, so pleasant, so ingenuous are his
manners, so intrepid, and yet so humane! Montague is a fine
gentleman, but Augustus Harley is more&mdash;<i>he is a man!</i>'</p>

<p>She began to grow eloquent on this, apparently, exhaustless theme,
nor did she cease her panegyric till we came in view of Mrs Harley's
mansion.</p>

<p>'You will love the mother as well as the son,' continued this
agreeable prattler, 'when you come to know her; she is very good and
very sensible.'</p>

<p>Drawing near the house, she tripped from me, to enquire if its
mistress had yet risen.</p>

<p>A small white tenement, half obscured in shrubbery, on a verdant
lawn, of dimensions equally modest, situated on the side of a hill, and
commanding an extensive and variegated prospect, was too interesting
and picturesque an object, not to engage for some moments my
attention. The image of Augustus, also, which my lively companion
had pourtrayed with more than her usual vivacity, played in my fancy&mdash;my
heart paid involuntary homage to virtue, and I entered the
mansion of Mrs Harley with a swelling emotion, made up of
complicated feelings&mdash;half respectful, half tender&mdash;sentiments, too
mingled to be distinctly traced. I was introduced into a room that
overlooked a pleasant garden, and which the servant called a library.
It was hung with green paper, the carpet the same colour, green
venetian blinds to the windows, a sopha and chairs covered with
white dimity; some drawings and engravings hung on the walls,
arranged with exact symmetry; on one side of the room stood a grand
piano-forte, opposite to which, was a handsome book-case, filled with
books, elegantly bound; in the middle of the apartment was placed a
table, covered with a green cloth, on which was a reading desk, some
books and pamphlets, with implements for writing and drawing.
Nothing seemed costly, yet neatness, order, and taste, appeared
through the whole apartment, bespeaking the elegant and cultivated
mind of the owner.</p>

<p>After amusing myself for a short time, in this charming retirement,
I was summoned by Ann to the breakfast room, where Mrs Harley
awaited me. I was interested, at the first glance, in favour of this
amiable woman&mdash;she appeared to be near fifty, her person agreeable,
her countenance animated, her address engaging, and her manners
polished. Mutually pleased with each other, the hours passed rapidly;
and, till reminded by a significant look from my little friend, I was
unconscious, that I had made my visit of an unreasonable length.</p>

<p>Mrs Harley spoke much of her son, he was the darling and the
pride of her heart; she lamented the distance that separated them,
and wished, that her health, and his tenderness, would allow of her
residence with him in London. When conversing on this favourite
topic, a glow enlivened her countenance, and her eyes sparkled with a
humid brightness. I was affected by her maternal love&mdash;tender
remembrances, and painful comparisons, crouded into my mind&mdash;a
tear fell, that would not be twinkled away&mdash;she observed it, and
seemed to feel its meaning; she held out her hand to me, I took it and
pressed it to my lips. At parting, she entreated me speedily to renew
my visit, to come often without ceremony&mdash;I should cheer her
solitude&mdash;my sympathy, for she perceived I had a feeling heart,
would help to console her in the absence of her Augustus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XVII" id="ch_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p>On our way home, Ann was in high spirits, congratulating herself
upon her sagacity.</p>

<p>'Mrs Harley,' (said she, archly leering in my face) 'will console you
for the departure of Mr Francis.'</p>

<p>I smiled without replying. At dinner our visit of the morning was
canvassed (Ann had wished me to conceal it, but this I positively
refused). Mr Morton spoke of Mrs Harley and her son with great
respect, Mrs Morton with a sarcastic sneer, accompanied with a
reprimand to her daughter, for the improper liberty she had taken.</p>

<p>I quitted the table, immediately after the desert, to stifle my
disgust, and, taking a book, wandered into the pleasure grounds, but
incapable of fixing my attention, I presently shut my book, and,
sauntering slowly on, indulged in a reverie. My melancholy
reflections again returned&mdash;How could I remain in a house, where I
was every day marked out for insult by its mistress&mdash;and where was I
to dispose of myself? My fortune was insufficient to allow of my
boarding in a respectable family. Mrs Harley came across my mind&mdash;Amiable
woman!&mdash;Would she, <ins class="original has inded">indeed</ins>, accept of my society, and allow
me to soften her solitude!&mdash;But her income was little less limited
than my own&mdash;it must not be thought of. I reflected on the
inequalities of society, the source of every misery and of every vice,
and on the peculiar disadvantages of my sex. I sighed bitterly; and,
clasping my hands together, exclaimed, unconsciously&mdash;</p>

<p>'Whither can I go&mdash;and where shall I find an asylum?'</p>

<p>'Allow me to propose one,' said a voice, in a soft accent, suddenly,
behind me.</p>

<p>I started, turned, and beheld Mr Montague. After some
expressions of sympathy for the distress which he had witnessed,
apologies for his intrusion, and incoherent expressions of respect and
regard, he somewhat abruptly offered his hand and heart to my
acceptance, with the impetuosity which accompanied all his sentiments
and actions; yet, he expressed himself with the air of a man
who believes he is conferring an obligation. I thanked him for his
generous proposal&mdash;</p>

<p>But, as my heart spake not in his favour&mdash;'I must be allowed to
decline it.'</p>

<p>'That heart,' said he, rudely, 'is already bestowed upon another.'</p>

<p>'Certainly not, Mr Montague; if it were, I would frankly tell you.'</p>

<p>He pronounced the name of Mr Francis&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr Francis is a man for whom I feel a sincere respect and
veneration&mdash;a man whom I should be proud to call my friend; but a
thought beyond that, I dare venture to say, has never occurred to
either of us.'</p>

<p>He knew not how to conceive&mdash;that a woman in my situation,
unprepossessed, could reject so advantageous an establishment!</p>

<p>This, I told him, was indelicate, both to me and to himself. Were
my situation yet more desolate, I would not marry any man, merely
for an <i>establishment</i>, for whom I did not feel an affection.</p>

<p>Would I please to describe to him the model of perfection which I
should require in a husband?</p>

<p>It was unnecessary; as I saw no probability of the portrait bearing
any resemblance to himself.</p>

<p>He reddened, and turned pale, alternately; bit his lips, and
muttered to himself.&mdash;'Damned romantic affectation!'</p>

<p>I assumed a firmer tone&mdash;methought he insulted me.&mdash;'I beg you
will leave me, Sir&mdash;I chuse to be alone&mdash;By what right do you
intrude upon my retirements?'</p>

<p>My determined accent abashed him:&mdash;he tried, but with an ill
grace, to be humble; and entreated me to take time for consideration.</p>

<p>'There is no need of it. It is a principle with me, not to inflict a
moment's suspence on any human being, when my own mind is
decided.'</p>

<p>'Then you absolutely refuse me, and prefer the being exposed to
the mean and envious insults of the vulgar mistress of this mansion!'</p>

<p>'Of the two evils, I consider it as the least, because it involves no
permanent obligation.'</p>

<p>His countenance was convulsed with passion. His love, he told me,
was converted into vengeance by my scorn: he was not to be
contemned with impunity; and he warned me to beware.</p>

<p>I smiled, I believe, a little too contemptuously. 'You love me not,
Sir; I am glad, for your own sake, that you never loved me.'</p>

<p>'My hatred may be more terrible!'</p>

<p>'You cannot intimidate me&mdash;I am little accustomed to fear.'</p>

<p>I turned from him somewhat disdainfully: but, instantly recollecting
myself, I stepped back, and apologized for the harsh manner into
which I had been betrayed by his abrupt address, vehement
expostulation, and the previous irritated state of my mind.</p>

<p>'I acknowledge,' said I, 'the disinterestedness of your proposal, and
the <i>distinction</i> which it implies. Will you allow my own wounded
feelings to be an excuse for the too little consideration with which I
have treated <i>your's</i>? Can you forgive me?' added I, in a conciliating
tone, holding out my hand.</p>

<p>The strong emotions, which rapidly succeeded each other in his
mind, were painted in his countenance. After a moment's hesitation,
he snatched the hand I offered him, pressed it to his lips, and,
murmuring a few incoherent words, burst into tears. My spirits were
already depressed&mdash;affected by these marks of his sensibility, and still
more distressed by the recollection of the pain I had occasioned him
by my inconsiderate behaviour, I wept with him for some minutes in
silence.</p>

<p>'Let us no more,' resumed I, making an effort to recover myself,
'renew these impressions. I thank you sincerely for the sympathy you
have manifested for my situation. I am sensible that I have yielded to
weak and wayward feelings.&mdash;I have youth, health, and activity&mdash;I
ought not&mdash;neither do I despair.&mdash;The mortifications I have
experienced, since my residence here, will afford me a useful lesson
for the future&mdash;they have already taught me, what I before merely
conjectured, <i>the value of independence</i>!'</p>

<p>'Why, then,' interrupted he with quickness, 'do you reject an
opportunity of placing yourself out of the reach of insult?'</p>

<p>'Stop, my good friend,' replied I, smilingly looking in his face;
'there is a possibility of exchanging evils. You are yet too young, and
too unstable, maturely to have weighed the importance of the scheme
you propose. Remember, likewise, that you are, yourself, in a great
measure, dependent on the will of your father; and that much
reflection is requisite before we fetter ourselves with engagements,
that, once entered into, are not easily dissolved.'</p>

<p>'You allow me, then, to hope!'</p>

<p>'Indeed I meant not to imply any such thing. I wish to soften what I
have already expressed&mdash;but, there are a variety of reasons which
oblige me to assure you, that I see no probability of changing my
sentiments on the subject.'</p>

<p>'Why, then, this cruel ostentation? I would either love or hate, bless
or curse you.'</p>

<p>'You shall do neither, if I can prevent it. If my esteem is of any
value to you, you must learn to respect both me and yourself.'</p>

<p>'Esteem!&mdash;Is that to be my frigid reward!'</p>

<p>'If <i>mine</i> be worthless, propose to yourself <i>your own</i> as a
recompense.'</p>

<p>'I have already forfeited it, by seeking to move a heart, that
triumphs in its cold inflexibility.'</p>

<p>'Is this just&mdash;is it kind? Is it, indeed, <i>my welfare</i> you seek, while you
can thus add to the vexations and embarrassment, which were before
sufficiently oppressive? I would preserve you from an act of
precipitation and imprudence;&mdash;in return, you load me with
unmerited reproaches. But it is time to put an end to a conversation,
that can answer little other purpose than vain recrimination.'</p>

<p>He was about to speak&mdash;'Say no more&mdash;I feel myself, again, in
danger of losing my temper&mdash;my spirits are agitated&mdash;I would not
give you pain&mdash;Allow me to retire, and be assured of my best wishes.'</p>

<p>Some of the family appearing in sight, as if advancing towards us,
favoured my retreat. I quitted the place with precipitation, and retired
to my chamber, where I sought, by employing myself, to calm the
perturbation of my heart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XVIII" id="ch_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p>In a few days I renewed my visit to Mrs Harley:&mdash;a strong sympathy
united us, and we became almost inseparable. Every day I discovered
in this admirable woman a new and indissoluble tie, that bound me to
her. Her cultivated understanding afforded an inexhaustible fund of
instruction and entertainment; and her affectionate heart spread a
charm over her most indifferent actions. We read, we walked, we
conversed together; but, with whatever subjects these conversations
commenced, some associated idea always led them to terminate in an
eulogium on the virtues and talents, or an expression of regret, for
the absence of Augustus. There was a portrait of him (drawn by a
celebrated artist, which he had lately sent from town as a present to
his mother) hung up in the library. I accustomed myself to gaze on
this resemblance of a man, in whose character I felt so lively an
interest, till, I fancied, I read in the features all the qualities imputed
to the original by a tender and partial parent.</p>

<p>Cut off from the society of mankind, and unable to expound my
sensations, all the strong affections of my soul seemed concentrated
to a single point. Without being conscious of it, my grateful love for
Mrs Harley had, already, by a transition easy to be traced by a
philosophic mind, transferred itself to her son. He was the St Preux,
the Emilius of my sleeping and waking reveries. I now spent almost
my whole time in the cottage of my friend, returning to Morton Park
late in the evening, and <ins title="original has qutting">quitting</ins> it early in the morning, and
sometimes being wholly absent for weeks together.</p>

<p>Six months thus passed away in tranquillity, with but little
variation. Mr Montague, during this period, had several times left Mr
Morton's, and returned again abruptly: his manners became sullen,
and even, at times, ferocious. I carefully avoided encountering him,
fearful of exasperating a spirit, that appeared every moment on the
verge of excess.</p>

<p>Hastening one evening to my friend, after a longer separation than
common, (having been prevailed on by Mr Morton and his daughters
to accompany them on a distant visit, where business of Mr Morton's
detained us for some days) I ran into the library, as usual, and threw
myself into the arms of Mrs Harley, that opened spontaneously to
receive me.</p>

<p>'Ah! you little truant,' said she, in a voice of kindness, 'where have
you been so long? My son has visited me in your absence; he passed
through this part of the country, in his way to the seat of a friend. He
staid with me two days, during which I sent half a dozen messages to
Morton Park, but you were flown away, it seems, nor could I learn
any tidings of you. Augustus,' continued she, without observing the
emotions she excited, 'had scarcely quitted the house an hour when
you arrived.'</p>

<p>I made no reply; an unaccountable sensation seized, and
oppressed, my heart&mdash;sinking on the sopha, I burst into a convulsive
flood of tears.</p>

<p>My friend was struck: all the indiscretion of her conduct (as she
has since told me) flashed suddenly into her mind; she felt that, in
indulging her own maternal sensations, she had, perhaps, done me an
irreparable injury, and she shuddered at the probable consequences.
It was some moments before either of us recovered;&mdash;our
conversation was that evening, for the first time, constrained,
reserved, and painful; and we retired at an early hour to our
respective apartments.</p>

<p>I spent the night in self-examination. I was compelled to
acknowledge, to myself, that solitude, the absence of other
impressions, the previous circumstances that had operated on my
character, my friendship for Mrs Harley, and her eloquent,
affectionate, reiterated, praises of her son, had combined to awaken
all the exquisite, though dormant, sensibilities of my nature; and,
however romantic it might appear to others, and did appear even to
myself, I felt, that I loved an ideal object (for such was Augustus
Harley to me) with a tender and fervent excess; an excess, perhaps,
involving all my future usefulness and welfare. 'People, in general,'
says Rousseau, 'do not sufficiently consider the influence which the
first attachments, between man and woman, have over the remainder
of their lives; they do not perceive, that an impression so strong, and
so lively, as that of love, is productive of a long chain of effects, which
pass unobserved in a course of years, yet, nevertheless, continue to
operate till the day of their deaths.' It was in vain I attempted to
combat this illusion; my reason was but an auxiliary to my passion, it
persuaded me, that I was only doing justice to high and uncommon
worth; imagination lent her aid, and an importunate sensibility,
panting after good unalloyed, completed the seduction.</p>

<p>From this period Mrs Harley was more guarded in her conduct;
she carefully avoided the mention of her son.&mdash;Under pretence of
having an alteration made in the frame, she removed his picture from
the library; but the constraint she put upon herself was too evident
and painful; we no longer sought, with equal ardour, an interchange
of sentiment, reserve took place of the tender confidence of
friendship; a thousand times, while I gazed upon her dear averted
countenance, I yearned to throw myself upon her bosom, to weep, to
unfold to her the inmost recesses of my mind&mdash;that ingenuous mind,
which languished for communication, and preyed upon itself! Dear
and cruel friend, why did you transfix my heart with the barbed and
envenomed arrow, and then refuse to administer the only healing
balsam?</p>

<p>My visits to Mrs Harley became less frequent; I shut myself up
whole days in my apartment, at Morton Park, or wandered through
its now leafless groves, absorbed in meditation&mdash;fostering the sickly
sensibility of my soul, and nursing wild, improbable, chimerical,
visions of felicity, that, touched by the sober wand of truth, would
have 'melted into thin air.' 'The more desires I have' (observes an
acute, and profound French Philosopher<a name="fn_4r" id="fn_4r"></a><a href="#fn_4"><sup><span class="small">4</span></sup></a>) 'the less ardent they are.
The torrents that divide themselves into many branches are the least
dangerous in their course. A strong passion is a solitary passion, that
concentrates all our desires within one point.'</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XIX" id="ch_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p>I had not seen my friend for many days, when, on a dark and stormy
night, in the month of January, between nine and ten o'clock, the
family at Morton Park were alarmed, by a loud and violent knocking
at the hall door.</p>

<p>On opening it, a servant appeared&mdash;and a chaise, the porter having
unbolted the great gates, drew up to the door. The man delivered a
note addressed to Miss Courtney. I was unacquainted with the
handwriting, and unfolded it with trepidation. It contained but a few
lines, written in a female character, and signed with the name of a
lady, who resided about twelve miles from Morton Park, at whose
house Mrs Harley sometimes made a visit of a few days. It stated&mdash;</p>

<p>'That my friend was seized at the mansion of this lady with an
apoplectic fit, from which she had been restored, after some hours of
insensibility: that the physicians were apprehensive of a relapse, and
that Mrs Harley had expressed a desire of seeing Miss Courtney&mdash;A
carriage and servants were sent for her conveyance.'</p>

<p>Mr Morton was from home, his lady made no offer of any of her
own domestics to accompany me. Montague, who had been at the
Park for some days past, solicited permission to be my escort. I
hesitated a moment, and would willingly have declined this proposal,
but he repeated and enforced it with a vehemence, that, in the
present hurried state of my mind, I had not spirits to oppose.
Shocked, alarmed, distressed, I wrapped a shawl round me, and
sprang into the chaise. Montague stepped in after me, and seated
himself by my side; the horses galloped, or rather flew down the
avenue, that led to the high road.</p>

<p>We travelled with great swiftness, and in uninterrupted silence for
some miles: the darkness was so thick and profound, that I could not
discover the road we took, and I began to feel very impatient to arrive
at the place of our destination. I questioned my companion respecting
his knowledge of our situation, and expressed an apprehension, that
we might possibly have missed the way. He made no reply to my
interrogation, but, starting as if from a reverie, seized my hand, while
his own trembled with a visible agitation, and began once more to
urge a suit, which I had hoped the steadiness and consistency of my
conduct had induced him entirely to relinquish.</p>

<p>'Is this a time, Mr Montague, for an address of this nature&mdash;do
you believe, that my favour is to be gained by these proofs of
inconsideration? Have some respect for the claims of humanity and
friendship, and, in seeking my affection, do not forfeit my esteem.'</p>

<p>He was about to reply, and I could perceive by the few words
which he uttered, and by the tone of his voice, that he struggled, in
vain, to rein in his quick and irascible spirit; when, in turning a sharp
angle of the road, the horses took fright at some object, indistinctly
seen, and ran precipitately down a steep hill, with a velocity that
threatened immediate destruction.</p>

<p>My companion, forcing open the door, seemed inclined to leap
from the carriage, but hesitated, as if unwilling to desert me in so
imminent a danger; I exhorted him to think only of providing for his
own safety, and, letting down the glasses on the side on which I sat, I
resigned myself to my fate. In springing from the chaise, by some
means, Montague entangled his coat in the step&mdash;he fell, without
clearing it, and I felt, with a horror that congealed my blood, the
wheel go over him. In a few minutes, I perceived a traveller, at the
risque of his own life, endeavouring to stop the horses&mdash;the pole of
the chaise striking him with great force, he was obliged to relinquish
his humane efforts&mdash;but this impediment occasioning the restive
animals to turn out of the road, they ran furiously up a bank, and
overset the carriage. I felt it going, and sitting, with my arms folded,
close in the lower corner, fell with it, without attempting to struggle,
by which means I escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>The stranger, once more, came to our assistance, and, the mettle
of the horses being now pretty well exhausted, my deliverer was
enabled to cut the traces, and then hastened to extricate me from my
perilous situation. It was some time before I recovered myself
sufficiently to thank him for his humanity, and to assure him, that I
had received no other injury than from my fears. I then mentioned to
him, my apprehensions for the fate of my fellow traveller, entreating
that he would return with me in search of him. With this request he
immediately complied, leaving the horses in the care of the servants,
neither of which had received any material hurt.</p>

<p>We soon discovered the unfortunate Montague, lying in the road,
in a melancholy situation: the wheel had gone over one of his legs,
the bone of which was broken and splintered in a terrible manner,
and, having fainted from the pain, we were at first apprehensive that
he was already dead. Turning from this shocking spectacle, a faint
sickness overspread my heart, the stranger supported me in his
arms, while a violent burst of tears preserved me from swooning. My
companion examining the body, perceived signs of life, and, by our
united efforts, sense and recollection were soon restored.</p>

<p>I remained with Montague while the stranger returned to the
carriage, to enquire what damages it had received, and whether it was
in a condition to proceed to the next village, which, the postilion
informed him, was near two miles from the spot where the accident
had happened, and we were, yet, five miles from the place whither we
were going. The axle-tree and one of the hind wheels, upon
examination, were found broken, the traces had been cut in pieces,
and the horses, had the chaise been in a better condition, were so
unmanageable, in consequence of their late fright, that it would have
been dangerous to have attempted putting them again into harness.</p>

<p>With this intelligence, our kind friend came back to us&mdash;We held a
short consultation, on the means most proper to be adopted, and, at
length it was determined, that, after placing Montague in the
carriage, where he should be sheltered from the inclemency of the
elements, and leaving him in the charge of the servants, the traveller
and myself should walk onward to the village, and send a chaise, or
litter, for the conveyance of our unfortunate companion.</p>

<p>To this proposal Montague assented, at the same time, declaring it
to be his intention, to proceed directly across the country, to the
house of his father, which could not, he conjectured, be at any great
distance, and where he should be assured of meeting with greater
attention, and more skilful assistance, than at a petty inn, in a paltry
village. Having thus adjusted our plan, and, with the help of the
servants, carefully placed Montague in the chaise, we proceeded
towards the village.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XX" id="ch_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<p>The night was tempestuous, and, though the moon was now rising,
her light was every moment obscured by dark clouds, discharging
frequent and heavy showers of rain, accompanied by furious gusts of
wind. After walking near a mile we entered upon a wide heath, which
afforded no shelter from the weather. I perceived my companion's
steps began to grow feeble, and his voice faint. The moon suddenly
emerging from a thick cloud, I observed his countenance, and
methought his features seemed familiar to me; but they were
overspread by a pallid and death-like hue. He stopped suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>'I am very ill,' said he, in a tone of voice that penetrated into my
soul, 'and can proceed no further.'</p>

<p>He sunk upon the turf. Seating myself beside him, while his head
fell on my shoulder, I threw around him my supporting arms. His
temples were bedewed with a cold sweat, and he appeared to be in
expiring agonies. A violent sickness succeeded, followed by an
hemorrhage.</p>

<p>'Gracious God!' I exclaimed, 'you have broken a blood vessel!'</p>

<p>'I fear so,' he replied. 'I have felt strangely disordered since the
blow I received from the pole of the carriage; but, till this moment, I
have not been at leisure to attend to my sensations.'</p>

<p>'Do not talk,' cried I, wildly; 'do not exhaust yourself.'</p>

<p>Again the clouds gathered; an impetuous gust of wind swept over
the heath, and the rain fell in torrents. Unconscious of what I did, I
clasped the stranger to my throbbing bosom,&mdash;the coldness of death
seemed upon him&mdash;I wrapped my shawl around him, vainly
attempting to screen him from the piercing blast. He spake not; my
terrified imagination already represented him as a lifeless corpse; I
sat motionless for some minutes, in the torpor of despair.</p>

<p>From this horrible situation, I was, at length, roused, by the sound
of a distant team: breathless, I listened for a few moments; I again
distinctly heard it wafted upon the wind; when, gently reclining my
charge on the grass, I started from the ground, and ran swiftly
towards the highway. The sound approached, and the clouds once
more breaking, and discovering a watery moon-light gleam, I
perceived, with joy, a waggon loaded with hay. I bounded over a part
of the turf that still separated me from the road, and accosting the
driver, explained to him, in a few words, as much of my situation as
was necessary; and, entreating his assistance, allured him by the hope
of a reward.</p>

<p>We returned to my patient; he raised his head on my approach,
and attempted to speak; but, enjoining him silence, he took my hand,
and, by a gentle pressure, expressed his sense of my cares more
eloquently than by words. I assisted the countryman in supporting
him to the road. We prepared for him, in the waggon, a soft bed of
hay, upon which we placed him; and, resting his head on my lap, we
proceeded gently to the nearest village. On our arrival at an
indifferent inn, I ordered a bed to be immediately prepared for him,
and sent a man and horse express, to the next town, for medical
assistance: at the same time, relating in brief the accidents of the
night, I dispatched a carriage for the relief of Montague, who was
conveyed, according to his wishes, to the house of his father.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all my precautions, the moving brought on a
relapse of the alarming symptoms; the discharge of blood returned
with aggravated violence, and, when the physician arrived, there
appeared in the unfortunate sufferer but little signs of life; but by the
application of styptics and cordials he once more began to revive;
and, about five in the morning, I was prevailed on, by the joint efforts
of the landlady and the humane Dr <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, to resign my seat at the
bed's head to a careful servant, and to recruit my exhausted strength
by a few hours' repose.</p>

<p>The vivid impressions, which had so rapidly succeeded each other
in my mind, for some time kept me waking, in a state of feverish
agitation; but my harrassed spirits were at length relieved by wearied
nature's kind restorer, and I slept for four hours profoundly.</p>

<p>On waking, my first enquiry was after my companion, in whose
state I felt an unusual degree of interest; and I heard, with pleasure,
that the hemorrhage had not returned; that he had rested with
apparent tranquillity, and appeared revived. I dressed myself hastily,
and passed into his apartment: he faintly smiled on perceiving my
approach, and gave me his hand.&mdash;The physician had ordered him to
be kept quiet, and I would not suffer him to speak; but,
contemplating more attentively his countenance, which had the night
before struck me with a confused recollection&mdash;what were my
emotions, on tracing the beloved features of Augustus Harley! His
resemblance, not only to the portrait, but to his mother, could not, as
I thought, be mistaken. A universal trembling seized me&mdash;I hastened
out of the apartment with tottering steps, and shutting myself into my
chamber, a tide of melancholy emotions gushed upon my heart. I
wept, without knowing wherefore, tears half delicious, half agonizing!
Quickly coming to myself, I returned to the chamber of my patient,
(now more tenderly endeared) which, officiating as a nurse for five
days, I never quitted, except to take necessary rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>I had written to Mr Morton a minute account of all that happened,
merely suppressing the name of my deliverer: to this letter I received
no reply; but had the pleasure of hearing, on the return of my
messenger (who was commissioned to make enquiries), that Mrs
Harley had suffered no return of her disorder, and was daily
acquiring health and strength&mdash;I feared, yet, to acquaint her with the
situation of her son; not only on the account of her own late critical
situation, but, also, lest any <ins title="original has suddent">sudden</ins> agitation of spirits from the
arrival of his mother, might, in his present weak state, be fatal to
Augustus.</p>

<p>I now redoubled for him my cares and attentions: he grew hourly
better; and, when permitted to converse, expressed in lively terms his
grateful sense of my kindness. Ah! why did I misconstrue these
emotions, so natural in such circumstances&mdash;why did I flatter my
heart with the belief of a sympathy which did not, could not, exist!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXI" id="ch_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<p>As my patient began to acquire strength, I demanded of him his
name and family, that I might inform his friends of his situation. On
his answering 'Harley,' I enquired, smiling&mdash;</p>

<p>If he remembered hearing his mother speak of a little <i>Proteg&eacute;</i>,
Emma Courtney, whom she favoured with her partial friendship?</p>

<p>'Oh, yes!'&mdash;and his curiosity had been strongly awakened to
procure a sight of this lady.</p>

<p>'Behold her, then, in your nurse!'</p>

<p>'Is it possible!' he exclaimed, taking my hand, and pressing it with
his lips&mdash;'My sister!&mdash;my friend!&mdash;how shall I ever pay the debt I
owe you?'</p>

<p>'We will settle that matter another time; but it is now become
proper that I should inform your excellent mother of what has
happened, which I have hitherto delayed, lest surprise should be
prejudicial to you, and retard your recovery.'</p>

<p>I then recounted to him the particulars of the late occurrences, of
which he had before but a confused notion; adding my surprise, that
I had neither seen, nor heard, any thing from Mr Morton.</p>

<p>He informed me, in his turn, that, having received an express,
informing him of his mother's alarming situation, he immediately
quitted the seat of his friend, where he was on a visit, to hasten to
her; that, for this purpose, riding late, he by some means bewildered
himself through the darkness of the evening, by which mistake he
encountered our chaise, and he hoped was, in some measure,
notwithstanding the accidents which ensued, accessary to my
preservation.</p>

<p>I quitted him to write to my friend, whom I, at length, judged it
necessary to acquaint with his situation. On the receipt of my letter,
she flew to us on the wings of maternal tenderness&mdash;folded her
beloved Augustus, and myself, alternately to her affectionate bosom,
calling us 'her children&mdash;her darling children!&mdash;I was her guardian
angel&mdash;<i>the preserver of her son!</i>&mdash;and <i>he</i> only could repay my
goodness!' I ventured to raise my eyes to him&mdash;they met his&mdash;mine
were humid with tears of tenderness: a cloud passed over his brow&mdash;he
entreated his mother to restrain her transports&mdash;he was yet too
enfeebled to bear these emotions. She recollected herself in an
instant; and, after again embracing him, leaning on my arm, walked
out into the air, to relieve the tumultuous sensations that pressed
upon her heart.</p>

<p>Once more she made me recite, minutely, the late events&mdash;strained
me in her arms, repeatedly calling me&mdash;</p>

<p>'Her beloved daughter&mdash;the meritorious child of her affections&mdash;the
preserver of her Augustus!'</p>

<p>Every word she uttered sunk deep into my soul, that greedily
absorbed the delicious poison, prepared for me by the cruel hand of
more than maternal fondness.</p>

<p>I mentioned to her my having written to Mr Morton, and my
astonishment at his silence.</p>

<p>He had not yet returned, she informed me, to Morton Park; and
intimated, that some malicious stories, respecting my sudden
disappearance, had been circulated by Mrs Morton through the
neighbourhood. She had herself been under extreme solicitude on
my account. It was generally believed, from the turn Mrs Morton's
malice had given to the affair, that I had eloped with Mr Montague:&mdash;the
accident which had befallen him had been rumoured; but the
circumstances, and the occasion of it, had been variously related.
Confiding in my principles, she had waited with anxiety for the
elucidation of these mysterious accounts; lamenting herself as the
innocent occasion of them, yet assured they would, eventually, prove
to my honour. She commended the magnanimity, which her partial
friendship imputed to my behaviour, with all the enthusiasm of
affection, and execrated the baseness of Mrs Morton, who, having
received my letter, must have been acquainted with the real truth.</p>

<p>Her narration gave me many complicated, and painful, sensations;
but the good opinion of the world, however desirable it may be, as
connected with our utility, has ever been with me but a secondary
consideration. Confiding in the rectitude of my own conduct, I
composed my spirits; depending on that rectitude, and time, for
removing the malignant aspersions which at present clouded my
fame. The tale of slander, the basis of which is falsehood, will quietly
wear away; and should it not&mdash;how unfounded, frequently, are the
censures of the world&mdash;how confused its judgments! I entreated my
friend to say nothing, at present, to her son on this subject; it was yet
of importance that his mind should be kept still and tranquil.</p>

<p>We rejoined Augustus at the dinner hour, and spent the day
together in harmony and friendship. The physician calling in the
evening, Mrs Harley consulted him, whether it would be safe to
remove her son, as she was impatient to have him under her own roof.
To this the doctor made no objection, provided he was conveyed in
an easy carriage, and by short stages. On Mrs Harley's thanking him
for his polite and humane attention to his patient, smilingly pointing
to me, he replied&mdash;'Her thanks were misplaced.' His look was arch
and significant; it called a glow into my cheeks. I ventured, once
more, to steal a glance at Augustus: his features were again
overspread with a more than usual seriousness, while his eyes seemed
designedly averted. Mrs Harley sighed, and, abruptly changing the
subject, asked the physician an indifferent question, who soon after
took his leave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXII" id="ch_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p>In a few days we returned to the peaceful mansion of my maternal
friend. Augustus seemed revived by the little journey, while every
hour brought with it an increase of health and spirits. Mrs Harley
would not suffer me to speak of going to Morton Park in the absence
of its master; neither could Augustus spare his kind nurse:&mdash;'I must
stay,' he added, and methought his accents were softened, 'and
complete my charitable purpose.' My appearance again in the village,
the respectability, and the testimony, of my friends, cleared my fame;
and it was only at Morton Park, that any injurious suspicions were
affected to be entertained.</p>

<p>The hours flew on downy pinions:&mdash;my new <i>brother</i>, for so he
would call himself, endeavoured to testify his gratitude, by
encouraging and assisting me in the pursuit of learning and science:
he gave us lectures on astronomy and philosophy&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">'While truths divine came mended from his tongue.'</p>
</div>

<p>I applied myself to the languages, and aided by my preceptor,
attained a general knowledge of the principles, and philosophy, of
criticism and grammar, and of the rules of composition. Every day
brought with it the acquisition of some new truth; and our intervals
from study were employed in music, in drawing, in conversation, in
reading the <i>belles lettres</i>&mdash;in&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
'The feast of reason, and the flow of souls.'<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The spring was advancing:&mdash;we now made little excursions, either
on horseback, in a chaise, or in a boat on the river, through the
adjacent country. The fraternal relation, which Augustus had
assumed, banished restraint, and assisted me in deceiving myself. I
drank in large and intoxicating draughts of a delicious poison, that
had circulated through every vein to my heart, before I was aware of
its progress. At length, part of a conversation, which I accidentally
overheard between Mrs Harley and her son, recalled me to a
temporary recollection.</p>

<p>I was seeking them in the garden, towards the dusk of the evening,
and a filbert hedge separated us. I heard the voice of my friend, as
speaking earnestly, and I unconsciously stopped.</p>

<p>'It would be a comfort to my declining years to see you the
husband of a woman of virtue and sensibility: domestic affections
meliorate the heart; no one ought to live wholly to himself.'</p>

<p>'Certainly not, neither does any one; but, in the present state of
society, there are many difficulties and anxieties attending these
connections: they are a lottery, and the prizes are few. I think,
perhaps, nearly with you, but my situation is, <i>in many respects, a
peculiar one</i>,'&mdash;and he sighed deeply:&mdash;Need I enumerate these
peculiarities to you? Neither do I pretend to have lived so long in the
world without imbibing many of its prejudices, and catching the
contagion of its habits.'</p>

<p>'They are unworthy of you.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so&mdash;but we will, if you please, change the subject; this to
me is not a pleasant one. What is become of my pupil? It is likely to
be a clear night; let us go in, and prepare for some astronomical
observations.'</p>

<p>My heart reproved me for listening, I crept back to my chamber&mdash;shed
one tear&mdash;heaved a convulsive, struggling, sigh&mdash;breathed on
my handkerchief, applied it to my eyes, and joined my friends in the
library.</p>

<p>Four months had rapidly passed&mdash;'the spot of azure in the cloudy
sky'&mdash;of my destiny. Mr Morton, I was informed, had returned to the
Park, and Augustus, whose health was now thoroughly restored,
talked of quitting the country. I advised with my friends, who agreed
with me, that it was now become proper for me to visit my uncle, and,
explaining to him the late events, justify my conduct. Mrs Harley and
her son offered to accompany me; but this, for many reasons, I
declined; taking my leave of them with a heavy heart, and promising,
if I were not kindly received, an immediate return.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXIII" id="ch_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p>On my arrival at Mr Morton's, the porter informed me, he was
ordered by his lady, to deny my entrance. My swelling heart!&mdash;a
sentiment of indignation distended it almost to suffocation.&mdash;At this
moment, Anne tripped lightly through the court-yard, and, seeing
me, ran to embrace me. I returned her caresses with warmth.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said she, 'you are not, you cannot be, guilty. I have been
longing to see you, and to hear all that has happened, but it was not
permitted me.' She added, in a whisper, 'I cannot love my mother,
for she torments and restrains me&mdash;my desire of liberty is stronger
than my duty&mdash;but I shall one day be able to outwit her.'</p>

<p>'Will not your father, my love, allow me to speak with him? I have a
right to be heard, and I demand his attention.'</p>

<p>'He is in his dressing-room,' said Ann, 'I will slide softly, to him,
and tell him you are here.'</p>

<p>Away she flew, and one of the footmen presently returned, to
conduct me to his master. I found him alone, he received me with a
grave and severe aspect. I related to him, circumstantially, the
occurrences which had taken place during his absence. My words,
my voice, my manner, were emphatic&mdash;animated with the energy of
truth&mdash;they extorted, they commanded, they, irresistibly, compelled
assent. His features softened, his eyes glistened, he held out his
hand, he was about to speak&mdash;he hesitated a moment, and sighed. At
this instant, Mrs Morton burst into the room, with the aspect of a
fury&mdash;her bloated countenance yet more swelled and hideous&mdash;I
shrunk back involuntarily&mdash;she poured forth a torrent of abuse and
invective. A momentary recollection reassured me&mdash;waiting till she
had exhausted her breath, I turned from her, and to her husband,
with calm dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>'I thank you, Sir, for all the kindness I have received from you&mdash;I
am convinced you do me justice&mdash;<i>for this I do not thank you</i>, it was a
duty to which I had a claim, and which you owed, not only to me,
but, to yourself. My longer continuance in this house, I feel, would
be improper. For the present, I return to Mrs Harley's, where I shall
respectfully receive, and maturely weigh, any counsels with which
you may in future think proper to favour me.'</p>

<p>Mr Morton bowed his head; poor man! his mild spirit was
overborne, he dared not assert the dictates of his own reason. I
hurried out of the apartment, and hastily embracing Ann, who
awaited me in the hall, charging myself with a hundred kisses for Mrs
Harley, I took the way to the hospitable mansion of my friend.</p>

<p>I had proceeded about half a mile, when I beheld Augustus,
advancing towards me; he observed my tremulous emotions, and
pallid countenance; he took my hand, holding it with a gentle
pressure, and, throwing his other arm round me, supported my
faultering steps. His voice was the voice of kindness&mdash;his
words spake assurance, and breathed hope&mdash;<i>fallacious hope!</i>&mdash;My
heart melted within me&mdash;my tremor encreased&mdash;I dissolved into
tears.</p>

<p>'A deserted outcast from society&mdash;a desolate orphan&mdash;what was to
become of me&mdash;to whom could I fly?'</p>

<p>'Unjust girl! have I then forfeited all your confidence&mdash;have you
not a mother and a friend, who love you&mdash;' he stopped&mdash;paused&mdash;and
added 'with maternal, with <i>fraternal</i>, tenderness? to whom would
you go?&mdash;remain with us, your society will cheer my mother's
declining years'&mdash;again he hesitated,&mdash;'I am about to return to town,
assure me, that you will continue with Mrs Harley&mdash;it will soften the
pain of separation.'</p>

<p>I struggled for more fortitude&mdash;hinted at the narrowness of my
fortune&mdash;at my wish to exert my talents in some way, that should
procure me a less dependent situation&mdash;spoke of my active spirit&mdash;of
my abhorrence of a life of indolence and vacuity.</p>

<p>He insisted on my waving these subjects for the present. 'There
would be time enough, in future, for their consideration. In the
mean while, I might go on improving myself, and whether present
or absent, might depend upon him, for every assistance in his
power.'</p>

<p>His soothing kindness, aided by the affectionate attentions of my
friend, gradually, lulled my mind into tranquillity. My bosom was
agitated, only, by a slight and sweet emotion&mdash;like the gentle
undulations of the ocean, when the winds, that swept over its ruffled
surface, are hushed into repose.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXIV" id="ch_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p>Another month passed away&mdash;every hour, I imbibed, in large
draughts, the deceitful poison of hope. A few days before that
appointed for the departure of Augustus, I received a visit from Mr
Montague, of whose situation, during his confinement, I had made
many enquiries, and it was with unaffected pleasure that I beheld him
perfectly restored to health. I introduced him to my friends, who
congratulated him upon his recovery, and treated him with that polite
and cordial hospitality which characterized them. He was on his way
to Morton Park, and was particular in his enquiries respecting the
late conduct of the lady of the mansion, of which he had heard some
confused reports. I could not conceal from him our final separation,
but, aware of his inflammable temper, I endeavoured to soften my
recital as far as was consistent with truth and justice. It was with
difficulty, that our united persuasions induced him to restrain his
fiery spirit, which broke out into menaces and execrations. I
represented to him&mdash;</p>

<p>'That every thing had been already explained; that the affair had
now subsided; that a reconciliation was neither probable nor
desirable; that any interference, on his part, would only tend to
mutual exasperation, from which I must eventually be the sufferer.'</p>

<p>I extorted from him a promise&mdash;that, as he was necessitated to
meet Mr Morton on business, he would make no allusions to the past&mdash;I
should be mortified, (I added) by having it supposed, that I stood
in need of a <i>champion</i>.&mdash;Mr Morton had no doubts of the rectitude of
my conduct, and it would be barbarous to involve him in a perpetual
domestic warfare.</p>

<p>Mr Montague, at the request of Augustus, spent that day, and the
next, with us. I thought, I perceived, that he regarded Mr Harley with
a scrutinizing eye, and observed my respect for, and attention to, him,
with jealous apprehension. Before his departure, he requested half an
hour's conversation with me alone, with which request I immediately
complied, and withdrew with him into an adjoining compartment. He
informed me&mdash;</p>

<p>'That he was going to London to pursue his medical studies&mdash;that,
on his return, his father had proposed to establish him in his
profession&mdash;that his prospects were very favourable, and that he
should esteem himself completely happy if he might, yet, hope to
soften my heart in his favour, and to place me in a more assured and
tranquil position.'</p>

<p>I breathed a heavy sigh, and sunk into a melancholy reverie.</p>

<p>'Speak to me, Emma,' said he, with impatience, 'and relieve the
anxiety I suffer.'</p>

<p>'Alas! What can I say?'</p>

<p>'Say, that you will try to love me, that you will reward my faith and
perseverance.'</p>

<p>'Would to God, I could'&mdash;I hesitated&mdash;my eyes filled with tears&mdash;'Go
to London,' resumed I; 'a thousand new objects will there
quickly obliterate from your remembrance a romantic and ill-fated
attachment, to which retirement, and the want of other impression,
has given birth, and which owes its strength merely to opposition.'</p>

<p>'As that opposition,' retorted he, 'is the offspring of pride and
insensibility&mdash;'</p>

<p>I looked at him with a mournful air&mdash;'Do not reproach me,
Montague, my situation is far more pitiable than yours. <i>I am, indeed,
unhappy</i>,'&mdash;added I, after a pause; 'I, like you, am the victim of a
raised, of, I fear, a distempered imagination.'</p>

<p>He eagerly entreated me to explain myself.</p>

<p>'I will not attempt to deceive you&mdash;I should accuse myself, were I
to preserve any sentiment, however delicate its nature, that might
tend to remove your present illusion. It is, I confess, with extreme
reluctance&mdash;with real pain'&mdash;I trembled&mdash;my voice faultered, and I
felt my colour vary&mdash;'that I constrain myself to acknowledge a
hopeless, an extravagant'&mdash;I stopped, unable to proceed.</p>

<p>Fire flashed from his eyes, he started from his seat, and took two
or three hasty strides across the room.</p>

<p>'I understand you, but too well&mdash;Augustus Harley shall dispute
with me a prize'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Stop, Sir, be not unjust&mdash;make not an ungenerous return to the
confidence I have reposed in you. Respect the violence which, on
your account, I have done to my own feelings. I own, that I have not
been able to defend my heart against the accomplishments and high
qualities of Mr Harley&mdash;I respected his virtues and attainments, and,
by a too easy transition&mdash;at length&mdash;<i>loved his person</i>. But my
tenderness is a secret to all the world but yourself&mdash;It has not met
with'&mdash;a burning blush suffused my cheek&mdash;'It has little hope of
meeting, a return. To your <i>honor</i> I have confided this cherished <i>secret</i>&mdash;dare
you betray my confidence? I know, you dare not!'</p>

<p>He seemed affected&mdash;his mind appeared torn by a variety of
conflicting emotions, that struggled for victory&mdash;he walked towards
me, and again to the door, several times. I approached him&mdash;I gave
him my hand&mdash;</p>

<p>'Adieu, Montague,' said I, in a softened accent&mdash;'Be assured of my
sympathy&mdash;of my esteem&mdash;of my best wishes! When you can meet
me with calmness, I shall rejoice to see you&mdash;<i>as a friend</i>. Amidst some
excesses, I perceive the seeds of real worth in your character,
cultivate them, they may yield a noble harvest. I shall not be forgetful
of the distinction <ins title="original has yo">you</ins> have shewn me, <i>when almost a deserted orphan</i>&mdash;Once
again&mdash;farewel, my friend, and&mdash;may God bless you!'</p>

<p>I precipitately withdrew my hand from his, and rushed out of the
room. I retired to my chamber, and it was some hours before my
spirits became sufficiently composed to allow me to rejoin my friends.
On meeting them, Mrs Harley mentioned, with some surprize, the
abrupt departure of Montague, who had quitted the house, without
taking leave of its owners, by whom he had been so politely received.</p>

<p>'He is a fine young man,' added she, 'but appears to be very
eccentric.'</p>

<p>Augustus was silent, but fixed his penetrating eyes on my face, with
an expression that covered me with confusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXV" id="ch_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p>The day fixed for the departure of Mr Harley, for London, now
drew near&mdash;I had anticipated this period with the most cruel
inquietude. I was going to lose, perhaps for ever, my preceptor, my
friend! He, from whom my mind had acquired knowledge, and in
whose presence my heart had rested satisfied. I had hitherto scarcely
formed a wish beyond that of daily beholding, and listening to him&mdash;I
was now to gaze on that beloved countenance, to listen to those
soothing accents, no longer. He was about to mix in the gay world&mdash;to
lose in the hurry of business, or of pleasure, the remembrance of
those tender, rational, tranquil, moments, sacred to virtue and
friendship, that had left an indelible impression on my heart. Could I,
indeed, flatter myself, that the idea of the timid, affectionate, Emma,
would ever recur to his mind in the tumultuous scenes of the
crouded metropolis, it would doubtless quickly be effaced, and lost in
the multiplicity of engagements and avocations. How should I, buried
in solitude and silence, recall it to his recollection, how contrive to
mingle it with his thoughts, and entangle it with his associations? Ah!
did he but know my tenderness&mdash;<i>the desire of being beloved</i>, of
inspiring sympathy, is congenial to the human heart&mdash;why should I
hesitate to inform him of my affection&mdash;why do I blush and tremble
at the mere idea? It is a false shame! It is a pernicious system of
morals, which teaches us that hypocrisy can be virtue! He is well
acquainted with the purity, and with the sincerity, of my heart&mdash;he
will at least regard me with esteem and tender pity&mdash;and how often
has 'pity melted the soul to love!' The experiment is, surely, innocent,
and little hazardous. What I have to apprehend? Can I distrust, for a
moment, those principles of rectitude, of honour, of goodness, which
gave birth to my affection? Have I not witnessed his humanity, have I
not experienced his delicacy, in a thousand instances? Though he
should be obliged to wound, he is incapable of insulting, the heart
that loves him; and that, loving him, believed, alas! for a long time,
<i>that it loved only virtue</i>!</p>

<p>The morning of our separation, at last, arrived. My friend, too
much indisposed to attend the breakfast table, took leave of her son
in her own apartment. I awaited him, in the library, with a beating
heart, and, on his departure, put into his hands a paper.&mdash;</p>

<p>'Read it not,' said I, in a low and almost inarticulate tone of voice,
'till arrived at the end of your journey; or, at least, till you are ten
miles from hence.'</p>

<p>He received it in silence; but it was a silence more expressive than
words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Suffer me,' it said, 'for a few moments, to solicit your candour and
attention. You are the only man in the world, to whom I could
venture to confide sentiments, that to many would be inconceivable;
and by those, who are unacquainted with the human mind, and the
variety of circumstances by which characters are variously impressed
and formed&mdash;who are accustomed to consider mankind in masses&mdash;who
have been used to bend implicitly, to custom and prescription&mdash;the
deviation of a solitary individual from <i>rules</i> sanctioned by usage,
by prejudice, by expediency, would be regarded as romantic. I frankly
avow, while my cheeks glow with the blushes of <i>modesty</i>, not of
shame, that your virtues and accomplishments have excited in my
bosom an affection, as pure as the motives which gave it birth, and as
animated as it is pure.&mdash;This ingenuous avowal may perhaps affect,
but will scarcely (I suspect) surprise, you; for, incapable of
dissimulation, the emotions of my mind are ever but too apparent in
my expressions, and in my conduct, to deceive a less penetrating eye
than yours&mdash;neither have I been solicitous to disguise them.</p>

<p>'It has been observed, that,' "the strength of an affection is
generally in the same proportion, as the character of the species, in
the object beloved, is lost in that of the individual,"<a name="fn_5r" id="fn_5r"></a><a href="#fn_5"><sup><span class="small">5</span></sup></a> and, that
individuality of character is the only fastener of the affections. It is
certain, however singular it may appear, that many months before we
became personally acquainted, the report of your worth and high
qualities had generated in my mind, an esteem and reverence, which
has gradually ripened into a tenderness, that has, at length, mixed
itself with all my associations, and is become interwoven with every
fibre of my heart.</p>

<p>'I have reflected, again and again, on the imprudence of cherishing
an attachment, which a variety of circumstances combine to render so
unpromising, and&mdash;What shall I say?&mdash;So peculiar is the constitution
of my mind, that those very circumstances have had a tendency
directly opposite to what might reasonably have been expected; and
have only served to render the sentiment, I have delighted to foster,
more affecting and interesting.&mdash;Yes! I am aware of the tenure upon
which you retain your fortunes&mdash;of the cruel and unnatural
conditions imposed on you by the capricious testator: neither can I
require a sacrifice which I am unable to recompence. But while these
melancholy convictions deprive me of hope, they encourage me, by
proving the disinterestedness of my attachment, to relieve my heart
by communication.&mdash;Mine is a whimsical pride, which dreads
nothing so much as the imputation of sordid, or sinister motives.
Remember, then&mdash;should we never meet again&mdash;if in future periods
you should find, that the friendship of the world is&mdash;"a shade that
follows wealth and fame;"&mdash;if, where you have conferred obligations,
you are repaid with ingratitude&mdash;where you have placed confidence,
with treachery&mdash;and where you have a claim to zeal, with coldness!
Remember, <i>that you have once been beloved, for yourself alone</i>, by one,
who, in contributing to the comfort of your life, would have found the
happiness of her own.</p>

<p>'Is it possible that a mind like yours, neither hardened by
prosperity, nor debased by fashionable levity&mdash;which vice has not
corrupted, nor ignorance brutalized&mdash;can be wholly insensible to the
balmy sweetness, which natural, unsophisticated, affections, shed
through the human heart?</p>

<p>'But I check my pen:&mdash;I am no longer&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
"The hope-flush'd enterer on the stage of life."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>'The dreams of youth, chaced by premature reflection, have given
place to soberer, to sadder, conclusions; and while I acknowledge,
that it would be inexpressibly soothing to me to believe, that in
happier circumstances, my artless affection might have awakened
in your mind a sympathetic tenderness:&mdash;this is the extent of my
hopes!&mdash;I recollect you once told me "It was our duty to make our
reason conquer the sensibility of our heart." Yet, why? Is, then,
apathy the perfection of our nature&mdash;and is not that nature refined
and harmonized by the gentle and social affections? The Being
who gave to the mind its reason, gave also to the heart its
sensibility.</p>

<p>'I make no apologies for, because I feel no consciousness of,
weakness. An attachment sanctioned by nature, reason, and virtue,
ennoble the mind capable of conceiving and cherishing it: of such
an attachment a corrupt heart is utterly incapable.</p>

<p>'You may tell me, perhaps, "that the portrait on which my fancy
has dwelt enamoured, owes all its graces, its glowing colouring&mdash;like
the ideal beauty of the ancient artists&mdash;to the imagination
capable of sketching the dangerous picture."&mdash;Allowing this, for a
moment, <i>the sentiments it inspires are not the less genuine</i>; and without
some degree of illusion, and enthusiasm, all that refines, exalts,
softens, embellishes, life&mdash;genius, virtue, love itself, languishes.
But, on this subject, my opinions have not been lightly formed:&mdash;it
is not to the personal graces, though "the body charms, because
the mind is seen," but to the virtues and talents of the individual
(for without intellect, virtue is an empty name), that my heart does
homage; and, were I never again to behold you&mdash;were you even
the husband of another&mdash;my tenderness (a tenderness as innocent
as it is lively) would never cease!</p>

<p>'But, methinks, I hear you say,&mdash;"Whither does all this tend,
and what end does it propose?" Alas! this is a question I scarcely
dare to ask myself!&mdash;Yet, allow me to request, that you will make
me one promise, and resolve me one question:&mdash;ah! do not evade
this enquiry; for much it imports me to have an explicit reply, lest,
in indulging my own feelings, I should, unconsciously, plant a
thorn in the bosom of another:&mdash;<i>Is your heart, at present, free?</i> Or
should you, in future, form a tender engagement, tell me, that I
shall receive the first intimation of it from yourself; and, in the
assurance of your happiness, I will learn to forget my own.</p>

<p>'I aspire to no higher title than that of the most faithful of your
friends, and the wish of becoming worthy of your esteem and
confidence shall afford me a motive for improvement. I will learn
of you moderation, equanimity, and self-command, and you will,
perhaps, continue to afford me direction, and assistance, in the
pursuit of knowledge and truth.</p>

<p>'I have laid down my pen, again and again, and still taken it up
to add something more, from an anxiety, lest even you, of whose
delicacy I have experienced repeated proofs, should misconstrue
me.&mdash;"Oh! what a world is this!&mdash;into what false habits has it
fallen! Can hypocrisy be virtue? Can a desire to call forth all the
best affections of the heart, be misconstrued into something too
degrading for expression?"<a name="fn_6r" id="fn_6r"></a><a href="#fn_6"><sup><span class="small">6</span></sup></a> But I will banish these apprehensions;
I am convinced they are injurious.</p>

<p>'Yes!&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;I relinquish my pen with reluctance. A
melancholy satisfaction, from what source I can scarcely define,
diffuses itself through my heart while I unfold to you its emotions.&mdash;Write
to me; be <i>ingenuous</i>; I desire, I call for, truth!</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXVI" id="ch_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p>I had not courage to make my friend a confident of the step I had
taken; so wild, and so romantic, did it appear, even to myself&mdash;a false
pride, a false shame, with-held me. I brooded in silence over the
sentiment, that preyed on the bosom which cherished it. Every
morning dawned with expectation, and every evening closed in
disappointment. I walked daily to the post-office, with precipitate
steps and a throbbing heart, to enquire for letters, but in vain; and
returned slow, dejected, spiritless. <i>Hope</i>, one hour, animated my
bosom and flushed my cheek; the next, pale despair shed its torpid
influence through my languid frame. Inquietude, at length, gradually
gave place to despondency, and I sunk into lassitude.</p>

<p>My studies no longer afforded me any pleasure. I turned over my
books, incapable of fixing my attention; took out my drawings, threw
them aside; moved, restless and dissatisfied, from seat to seat; sought,
with unconscious steps, the library, and, throwing myself on the
sopha, with folded arms, fixed my eyes on the picture of Augustus,
which had lately been replaced, and sunk into waking dreams of ideal
perfection and visionary bliss. I gazed on the lifeless features,
engraven on my heart in colours yet more true and vivid&mdash;but where
was the benignant smile, the intelligent glance, the varying
expression? Where the pleasant voice, whose accents had been
melody in my ear; that had cheered me in sadness, dispelled the
vapours of distrust and melancholy, and awakened my emulation for
science and improvement? Starting from a train of poignant and
distressing emotions, I fled from an apartment once so dear,
presenting now but the ghosts of departed pleasures&mdash;fled into the
woods, and buried myself in their deepest recesses; or, shutting
myself in my chamber, avoided the sight of my friend, whose dejected
countenance but the more forcibly reminded me&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
'That such things were, and were most dear.'<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In this state of mind, looking one day over my papers, without any
known end in view, I accidentally opened a letter from Mr Francis
(with whom I still continued, occasionally, to correspond), which I
had recently received. I eagerly seized, and re-perused, it. My spirits
were weakened; the kindness which it expressed affected me&mdash;it
touched my heart&mdash;it excited my tears. I determined instantly to reply
to it, and to acknowledge my sense of his goodness.</p>

<p>My mind was overwhelmed with the pressure of its own thoughts;
a gleam of joy darted through the thick mists that pervaded it;
communication would relieve the burthen. I took up my pen; and,
though I dared not betray the fatal secret concealed, as a sacred
treasure, in the bottom of my heart, I yet gave a loose to, I
endeavoured to paint, its sensations.</p>

<p>After briefly sketching the events that had driven me from Morton
Park (of which I had not hitherto judged it necessary to inform him),
without hinting the name of my deliverer, or suffering myself to dwell
on the services he had rendered me, I mentioned my present
temporary residence at the house of a friend, and expressed an
impatience at my solitary, inactive, situation.</p>

<p>I went on&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'To what purpose should I trouble you with a thousand wayward,
contradictory, ideas and emotions, that I am, myself, unable to
disentangle&mdash;which have, perhaps, floated in every mind, that has
had leisure for reflection&mdash;which are distinguished by no
originality, and which I may express (though not feel) without
force? I sought to cultivate my understanding, and exercise my
reason, that, by adding variety to my resources, I might increase
the number of my enjoyments: for <i>happiness</i> is, surely, the only
desirable <i>end</i> of existence! But when I ask myself, Whether I am
yet nearer to the end proposed?&mdash;I dare not deceive myself&mdash;sincerity
obliges me to answer in the negative. I daily perceive the
gay and the frivolous, among my sex, amused with every passing
trifle; gratified by the insipid <i>routine</i> of heartless, mindless,
intercourse; fully occupied, alternately, by domestic employment,
or the childish vanity of varying external ornaments, and "hanging
drapery on a smooth block." I do not affect to despise, and I
regularly practise, the necessary avocations of my sex; neither am I
superior to their vanities. The habits acquired by early precept and
example adhere tenaciously; and are never, perhaps, entirely
eradicated. But all these are insufficient to engross, to satisfy, the
active, aspiring, mind. Hemmed in on every side by the
constitutions of society, and not less so, it may be, by my own
prejudices&mdash;I perceive, indignantly perceive, the magic circle,
without knowing how to dissolve the powerful spell. While men
pursue interest, honor, pleasure, as accords with their several
dispositions, women, who have too much delicacy, sense, and
spirit, to degrade themselves by the vilest of all interchanges,
remain insulated beings, and must be content tamely to look on,
without taking any part in the great, though often absurd and
tragical, drama of life. Hence the eccentricities of conduct, with
which women of superior minds have been accused&mdash;the struggles,
the despairing though generous struggles, of an ardent spirit,
denied a scope for its exertions! The strong feelings, and strong
energies, which properly directed, in a field sufficiently wide, might&mdash;ah!
what might they not have aided? forced back, and pent up,
ravage and destroy the mind which gave them birth!</p>

<p>'Yes, I confess, <i>I am unhappy</i>, unhappy in proportion as I believe
myself (it may be, erringly) improved. Philosophy, it is said, should
regulate the feelings, but it has added fervor to mine! What are
passions, but another name for powers? The mind capable of
receiving the most forcible impressions is the sublimely improveable
mind! Yet, into whatever trains such minds are accidentally
directed, they are prone to enthusiasm, while the vulgar stupidly
wonder at the effects of powers, to them wholly inconceivable: the
weak and the timid, easily discouraged, are induced, by the first
failure, to relinquish their pursuits. "They make the impossibility
they fear!" But the bold and the persevering, from repeated
disappointment, derive only new ardor and activity. "They conquer
difficulties, by daring to attempt them."</p>

<p>'I feel, that I am writing in a desultory manner, that I am unable
to crowd my ideas into the compass of a letter, and, that could I do
so, I should perhaps only weary you. There are but few persons to
whom I would venture to complain, few would understand, and
still fewer sympathise with me. You are in health, they would say,
in the spring of life, have every thing supplied you without labour
(so much the worse) nature, reason, open to you their treasures!
All this is, partly, true&mdash;but, with inexpressible yearnings, my soul
pants for something more, something higher! The morning rises
upon me with sadness, and the evening closes with disgust&mdash;Imperfection,
uncertainty, is impressed on every object, on every
pursuit! I am either restless or torpid, I seek to-day, what to-morrow,
wearies and offends me.</p>

<p>'I entered life, flushed with hope&mdash;I have proceeded but a few
steps, and the parterre of roses, viewed in distant prospect, nearer
seen, proves a brake of thorns. The few worthy persons I have
known appear, to me, to be struggling with the same half
suppressed emotions.&mdash;Whence is all this? Why is intellect and
virtue so far from conferring happiness? Why is the active mind a
prey to the incessant conflict between truth and error? Shall I look
beyond the disorders which, <i>here</i>, appear to me so inexplicable?&mdash;shall
I expect, shall I demand, from the inscrutable Being to whom
I owe my existence, in future unconceived periods, the <i>end</i> of
which I believe myself capable, and which capacity, like a
tormenting <i>ignis fatuus</i>, has hitherto served only to torture and
betray? The animal rises up to satisfy the cravings of nature, and
lies down to repose, undisturbed by care&mdash;has man superior
powers, only to make him pre-eminently wretched?&mdash;wretched, it
seems to me, in proportion as he rises? Assist me, in disentangling
my bewildered ideas&mdash;write to me&mdash;reprove me&mdash;spare me not!</p>

<p class="right">

</blockquote>

<p>To this letter I quickly received a kind and consolatory reply,
though not unmingled with the reproof I called for. It afforded me
but a temporary relief, and I once more sunk into inanity; my
faculties rusted for want of exercise, my reason grew feeble, and my
imagination morbid.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXVII" id="ch_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p>A pacquet of letters, at length, arrived from London&mdash;Mrs Harley,
with a look that seemed to search the soul, put one into my hands&mdash;The
superscription bore the well known characters&mdash;yes, it was from
Augustus, and addressed to Emma&mdash;I ran, with it, into my chamber,
locked myself in, tore it almost asunder with a tremulous hand,
perused its contents with avidity&mdash;scarce daring to respire&mdash;I
reperused it again and again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I had trusted my confessions' (it said) 'to one who had made the
human heart his study, who could not be affected by them
improperly. It spoke of the illusions of the passions&mdash;of the false
and flattering medium through which they presented objects to our
view. He had answered my letter earlier, had it not involved him in
too many thoughts to do it with ease. There was a great part of it to
which he knew not how to reply&mdash;perhaps, on some subjects, it
was not necessary to be explicit. And now, it may be, he had better
be silent&mdash;he was dissatisfied with what he had written, but, were
he to write again, he doubted if he should please himself any
better.&mdash;He was highly flattered by the favourable opinion I
entertained of him, it was a grateful proof, not of his merit, but of
the warmth of my friendship, &amp;c. &amp;c.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This letter appeared to me vague, obscure, enigmatical. Unsatisfied,
disappointed, I felt, I had little to hope&mdash;and, yet, had no <i>distinct</i>
ground of fear. I brooded over it, I tortured its meaning into a
hundred forms&mdash;I spake of it to my friend, but in general terms, in
which she seemed to acquiesce: she appeared to have made a
determination, not to enquire after what I was unwilling to disclose;
she wholly confided both in my principles, and in those of her son: I
was wounded by what, entangled in prejudice, I conceived to be a
necessity for this reserve.</p>

<p>Again I addressed the man, whose image, in the absence of all
other impressions, I had suffered to gain in my mind this dangerous
ascendency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I, once more, take up my pen with a mind so full of thought,
that I foresee I am about to trespass on your time and patience&mdash;yet,
perhaps, to one who makes "the human heart his study," it
may not be wholly uninteresting to trace a faithful delineation of
the emotions and sentiments of an ingenuous, uncorrupted, mind&mdash;a
mind formed by solitude, and habits of reflection, to some
strength of character.</p>

<p>'If to have been more guarded and reserved would have been
more discreet, I have already forfeited all claim to this discretion&mdash;to
affect it now, would be vain, and, by pursuing a middle course, I
should resign the only advantage I may ever derive from my
sincerity, the advantage of expressing my thoughts and feelings
with freedom.</p>

<p>'The conduct, which I have been led to adopt, has been the
result of a combination of peculiar circumstances, <i>and is not what I
would recommend to general imitation</i>&mdash;To say nothing of the hazards
it might involve, I am aware, generally speaking, arguments might
be adduced, to prove, that certain customs, of which I, yet, think
there is reason to complain, may not have been unfounded in
nature&mdash;I am led to speak thus, because I am not willing to spare
myself, but would alledge all which you might have felt inclined to
hint, had you not been with-held by motives of delicate
consideration.</p>

<p>'Of what then, you may ask, do I complain?&mdash;Not of the laws of
nature! But when mind has given dignity to natural affections;
when reason, culture, taste, and delicacy, have combined to
chasten, to refine, to exalt (shall I say) to sanctity them&mdash;Is there,
then, no cause to complain of rigor and severity, that such minds
must either passively submit to a vile traffic, or be content to
relinquish all the endearing sympathies of life? Nature has formed
woman peculiarly susceptible of the tender affections. "The voice
of nature is too strong to be silenced by artificial precepts." To feel
these affections in a supreme degree, a mind enriched by literature
and expanded by fancy and reflection, is necessary&mdash;for it is
intellect and imagination only, that can give energy and interest
to&mdash;</p>

<p>'You may, perhaps, agree with me, that it is almost indifferent on
which side the sentiment originates. Yet, I confess, my frankness
has involved me in many after thoughts and inquietudes;
inquietudes, which all my reasoning is, at times, insufficient to
allay. The shame of being singular, it has been justly observed,<a name="fn_8r" id="fn_8r"></a><a href="#fn_8"><sup><span class="small">8</span></sup></a>
requires strong principles, and much native firmness of temper, to
surmount.&mdash;Those who deviate from the beaten track must expect
to be entangled in the thicket, and wounded by many a thorn&mdash;my
wandering feet have already been deeply pierced.</p>

<p>'I should vainly attempt to describe the struggles, the solicitudes,
the doubts, the apprehensions, that alternately rend my heart! I
feel, that I have "put to sea upon a shattered plank, and placed my
trust in miracles for safety." I dread, one moment, lest, in
attempting to awaken your tenderness, I may have forfeited your
respect; the next, that I have mistaken a delusive meteor for the
sober light of reason. In retirement, numberless contradictory
emotions revolve in my disturbed mind:&mdash;in company, I start and
shudder from accidental allusions, in which no one but myself
could trace any application. The end of doubt is the beginning of
repose. Say, then, to me, that it is a principle in human nature,
however ungenerous, to esteem lightly what may be attained
without difficulty.&mdash;Tell me to make distinctions between love and
friendship, of which I have, hitherto, been able to form no idea.&mdash;Say,
that the former is the caprice of fancy, founded on external
graces, to which I have little pretension, and that it is vain to
pretend, that&mdash;</p>

bear, and will still respect your integrity, and confide in your
principles; but I can no longer sustain a suspense that preys upon
my spirits. It is not the Book of Fate&mdash;it is your mind, only, I

<h3><a name="ch_XXVIII" id="ch_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<p>Week after week, month after month, passed away in the anguish of
vain expectation: my letter was not answered, and I again sunk into
despondency.&mdash;Winter drew near. I shuddered at the approach of
this dreary and desolate season, when I was roused by the receipt of a
letter from one of the daughters of the maternal aunt, under whose
care I had spent the happy, thoughtless, days of childhood. My
cousin informed me&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'That she had married an officer in the East India service; that
soon after their union he was ordered abroad, and stationed in
Bengal for three years, during which period she was to remain in a
commodious and pleasant house, situated in the vicinity of the
metropolis. She had been informed of my removal from Morton
Park, and had no doubt but I should be able to give a satisfactory
account of the occasion of that removal. She purposed, during the
absence of her husband, to let out a part of her house; and should
I not be fixed in my present residence, would be happy to
accommodate me with an apartment, on terms that should be
rather dictated by friendship than interest. She also hinted, that a
neighbouring lady, of respectable character, would be glad to avail
herself of the occasional assistance of an accomplished woman in
the education of her daughters; that she had mentioned me to her
in advantageous terms, conceiving that I should have no objection,
by such a means, to exercise my talents, to render myself useful,
and to augment my small income.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This intelligence filled me with delight: the idea of change, of
exertion, of new scenes&mdash;shall I add, <i>of breathing the same air with
Augustus</i>, rushed tumultuously through my imagination. Flying
eagerly to my friend, to impart these tidings, I was not aware of the
ungrateful and inconsiderate appearance which these exultations
must give me in her eyes, till I perceived the starting tear.&mdash;It
touched, it electrified, my heart; and, throwing myself into her arms,
I caught the soft contagion, and wept aloud.</p>

<p>'Go, Emma&mdash;my daughter,' said this excellent woman; 'I banish
the selfish regret that would prompt me to detain you. I perceive this
solitude is destructive to thy ardent mind. Go, vary your impressions,
and expand your sensations; gladden me only from time to time with
an account of your progress and welfare.'</p>

<p>I had but little preparation to make. I canvassed over, with my
friend, a thousand plans, and formed as many expectations and
conjectures; but they all secretly tended to one point, and
concentrated in one object. I gave my cousin notice that I should be
with her in a few days&mdash;settled a future correspondence with my
friend&mdash;embraced her, at parting, with unfeigned, and tender, sorrow&mdash;and,
placing myself in a stage-coach, that passed daily through the
village, took the road, once more, with a fluttering heart, to London.
We travelled all night&mdash;it was cold and dreary&mdash;but my fancy was
busied with various images, and my bosom throbbing with lively,
though indistinct sensations.</p>

<p>The next day, at noon, I arrived, without accident, at the residence
of my relation, Mrs Denbeigh. She received me with unaffected
cordiality: our former amity was renewed; we spent the evening
together, recalling past scenes; and, on retiring, I was shewn into a
neat chamber, which had been prepared for me, with a light closet
adjoining. The next day, I was introduced to the lady, mentioned to
me by my kind hostess, and agreed to devote three mornings in the
week to the instruction of the young ladies (her daughters), in various
branches of education.</p>

<h3>TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>'My friend, my son, it is for your benefit, that I have determined on
reviewing the sentiments, and the incidents, of my past life. Cold
declamation can avail but little towards the reformation of our errors.
It is by tracing, by developing, the passions in the minds of others;
tracing them, from the seeds by which they have been generated,
through all their extended consequences, that we learn, the more
effectually, to regulate and to subdue our own.</p>

<p>'I repeat, it will cost me some pain to be ingenuous in the recital
which I have pledged myself to give you; even in the moment when I
resume my pen, prejudice continues to struggle with principle, and I
feel an inclination to retract. While unfolding a series of error and
mortification, I tremble, lest, in warning you to shun the rocks and
quicksands amidst which my little bark has foundered, I should
forfeit your respect and esteem, the pride, and the comfort, of my
declining years. But you are deeply interested in my narrative, you tell
me, and you entreat me to proceed.'</p>

<h3><a name="ch_Ia" id="ch_Ia"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>Change of scene, regular employment, attention to my pupils, and
the conscious pride of independence, afforded a temporary relief to
my spirits. My first care, on my arrival in town, was to gladden the
mind of my dear benefactress, by a minute detail of the present
comforts and occupations.</p>

<p>She had charged me with affectionate remembrance and letters to
her son. I enclosed these letters; and, after informing him (in the
cover) of the change of my situation, and the incident which had
occasioned it, complained of the silence he had observed towards my
last letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;'If,' said I, 'from having observed the social and sympathetic
nature of our feelings and affections, I suffered myself to yield,
involuntarily, to the soothing idea, that the ingenuous avowal of an
attachment so tender, so sincere, so artless, as <ins title="original has mind">mine</ins>, could not
have been unaffecting to a mind with which my own proudly
claimed kindred:&mdash;if I fondly believed, that simplicity, modesty,
truth&mdash;the eye beaming with sensibility, the cheek mantling with
the glow of affection, the features softened, the accents modulated,
by ineffable tenderness, might, in the eyes of a virtuous man, have
supplied the place of more dazzling accomplishments, and more
seductive charms: if I over-rated my own merit, and my own
powers&mdash;surely my mistakes were sufficiently humiliating! You
should not, indeed you should not, have obliged me to arrive at the
conviction through a series of deductions so full of mortification
and anguish. You are too well acquainted with the human heart not
to be sensible, that no certainty can equal the misery of conjecture,
in a mind of ardour&mdash;the agonizing images which <i>suspense</i> forces
upon the tender and sensible heart! You should have written, in
pity to the situation of my mind. I would have thanked you for
being ingenuous, even though, like Hamlet, you had <i>spoke daggers</i>. I
expected it, from your character, and I had a claim to your
sincerity.</p>

<p>'But it is past!&mdash;the vision is dissolved! The barbed arrow is not
extracted with more pain, than the enchantments of hope from the
ardent and sanguine spirit! But why am I to lose your friendship?
My heart tells me, I have not deserved this! Do not suspect, that I
have so little justice, or so little magnanimity, as to refuse you the
privilege, the enviable privilege, of being master of your own
affections. I am unhappy, I confess; the principal charm of my life
is fled, and the hopes that should enliven future prospects are
faint: melancholy too often obscures reason, and a heart, perhaps
too tender, preys on itself.</p>

<p>'I suspect I had formed some vain and extravagant expectations.
I could have loved you, had you permitted it, with no mean, nor
common attachment.&mdash;My words, my looks, my actions, betrayed
me, ere I suffered my feelings to dictate to my pen. Would to God,
I had buried this fatal secret in the bottom of my soul! But
repentance is, now, too late. Yet the sensible heart yearns to disclose
itself&mdash;and to whom can it confide its sentiments, with equal
propriety, as to him who will know how to pity the errors, of which
he feels himself, however involuntarily, the cause? The world
might think my choice in a confident singular; it has been my
misfortune seldom to think with the world, and I ought, perhaps,
patiently to submit to the inconveniences to which this singularity
has exposed me.</p>

<p>'I know not how, without doing myself a painful violence, to
relinquish your society; and why, let me again ask, should I? I now
desire only that repose which is the end of doubt, and this, I think,
I should regain by one hour's frank conversation with you; I would
compose myself, listen to you, and yield to the sovereignty of
reason. After such an interview, my mind&mdash;no longer harrassed by
vague suspicion, by a thousand nameless apprehensions and
inquietudes&mdash;should struggle to subdue itself&mdash;at least, I would
not permit it to dictate to my pen, not to bewilder my conduct. I
am exhausted by perturbation. I ask only certainty and rest.</p>

<p>A few days after I had written the preceding letter, Mr Harley
called on me. Mrs Denbeigh was with me on his entrance; I would
have given worlds to have received him alone, but had not courage to
hint this to my relation. Overwhelmed by a variety of emotions, I was
unable for some time to make any reply to his friendly enquiries after
my health, and congratulations on my amended prospects. My
confusion and embarrassment were but too apparent; perceiving my
distress, he kindly contrived to engage my hostess in discourse, that I
might have time to rally my spirits. By degrees, I commanded myself
sufficiently to join in the conversation&mdash;I spoke to him of his mother,
expressed the lively sense I felt of her goodness, and my unaffected
regret at parting with her. Animated by my subject, and encouraged
by the delicacy of Augustus, I became more assured: we retraced the
amusements and studies of <span class="nowrap">H&mdash;&mdash;shire,</span> and two hours passed
delightfully and insensibly away, when Mrs Denbeigh was called out
of the room to speak to a person who brought her letters and
intelligence from the India House. Mr Harley, rising at the same time
from his seat, seemed about to depart, but hesitating, stood a few
moments as if irresolute.</p>

<p>'You leave me,' said I, in a low and tremulous tone, 'and you leave
me still in suspense?'</p>

<p>'Could you,' replied he, visibly affected, 'but have seen me on the
receipt of your last letter, you would have perceived that my feelings
were not enviable&mdash;Your affecting expostulation, added to other
circumstances of a vexatious nature, oppressed my spirits with a
burthen more than they were able to sustain.'</p>

<p>He resumed his seat, spoke of his situation, of the tenure on which
he held his fortune,&mdash;'I am neither a stoic nor a philosopher,' added
he,&mdash;'I knew not how&mdash;<i>I could not answer your letter</i>. What shall I say?&mdash;I
am with-held from explaining myself further, by reasons&mdash;<i>obligations</i>&mdash;Who
can look back on every action of his past life with
approbation? Mine has not been free from error! I am distressed,
perplexed&mdash;<i>Insuperable obstacles</i> forbid what otherwise'&mdash;</p>

<p>'I feel,' said I, interrupting him, 'that I am the victim of my own
weakness and vanity&mdash;I feel, that I have been rushing headlong into
the misery which you kindly sought to spare me&mdash;I am sensible of
your delicacy&mdash;of your humanity!&mdash;And is it with the full impression
of your virtues on my heart that I must teach that heart to renounce
you&mdash;renounce, for ever, the man with whose pure and elevated
mind my own panted to mingle? My reason has been blinded by the
illusions of my self-love&mdash;and, while I severely suffer, I own my
sufferings just&mdash;yet, the sentiments you inspired were worthy of you!
I understand little of&mdash;I have violated common forms&mdash;seeking your
tenderness, I have perhaps forfeited your esteem!'</p>

<p>'Far, <i>very far</i>, from it&mdash;I would, but cannot, say more.'</p>

<p>'Must we, then, separate for ever&mdash;will you no longer assist me in
the pursuit of knowledge and truth&mdash;will you no more point out to
me the books I should read, and aid me in forming a just judgment of
the principles they contain&mdash;Must all your lessons be at an end&mdash;all
my studies be resigned? How, without your counsel and example,
shall I regain my strength of mind&mdash;to what <i>end</i> shall I seek to
improve myself, when I dare no longer hope to be worthy of him&mdash;'</p>

<p>A flood of tears checked my utterance; hiding my face with my
hands, I gave way to the kindly relief, but for which my heart had
broken. I heard footsteps in the passage, and the voice of Mrs
Denbeigh as speaking to her servant&mdash;covered with shame and grief,
I dared not in this situation appear before her, but, rushing out at an
opposite door, hid myself in my chamber. A train of confused
recollections tortured my mind, I concluded, that Augustus had
another, a prior attachment. I felt, with this conviction, that I had not
the fortitude, and that perhaps I ought not, to see him again. I wrote
to him under this impression; I poured out my soul in anguish, in
sympathy, in fervent aspirations for his happiness. These painful and
protracted conflicts affected my health, a deep and habitual
depression preyed upon my spirits, and, surveying every object
through the medium of a distempered imagination, I grew disgusted
with life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_IIa" id="ch_IIa"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>I began, at length, to think, that I had been too precipitate, and too
severe to myself.&mdash;Why was I to sacrifice a friend, from whose
conversation I had derived improvement and pleasure? I repeated this
question to myself, again and again; and I blushed and repented. But
I deceived myself. I had too frequently acted with precipitation, I
determined, now, to be more prudent&mdash;I waited three months,
fortified my mind with many reflections, and resumed my pen&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'Near three months have elapsed, since I last addressed you. I
remind you of this, not merely to suppress, as it arises, any
apprehension which you may entertain of further embarrassment
or importunity: for I can no longer afflict myself with the idea, that
my peace, or welfare, are indifferent to you, but will rather adopt
the sentiment of Plato&mdash;who on being informed, that one of his
disciples, whom he had more particularly distinguished, had
spoken ill of him, replied, to the slanderer&mdash;"I do not believe you,
for it is impossible that I should not be esteemed by one whom I so
sincerely regard."</p>

<p>'My motive, for calling to your remembrance the date of my last,
is, that you should consider what I am now about to say, as the
result of calmer reflection, the decision of judgment after having
allowed the passions leisure to subside. It is, perhaps, unnecessary
to premise, that I am not urged on by pride, from an obscure
consciousness of having been betrayed into indiscretion, to
endeavour to explain away, or to extenuate, any part of my former
expressions or conduct. To a mind like yours, such an attempt
would be <ins title="original has impertiment">impertinent</ins>; from one like mine, I hope, superfluous. I
am not ashamed of being a human being, nor blush to own myself
liable to "the shakes and agues of his fragile nature." I have ever
spoken, and acted, from the genuine dictates of a mind swayed, at
the time, by its own views and propensities, nor have I hesitated, as
those views and propensities have changed, to avow my further
convictions&mdash;"Let not the coldly wise exult, that <ins title="original has thir">their</ins> heads were
never led astray by their hearts." I have all along used, and shall
continue to use, the unequivocal language of sincerity.</p>

<p>'However <i>romantic</i> (a vague term applied to every thing we do
not understand, or are unwilling to intimate) my views and
sentiments might appear to many, I dread not, from you, this frigid
censure. "The ideas, the associations, the circumstances of each
man are properly his own, and it is a pernicious system, that would
lead us to require all men, however different their circumstances,
to act in many of the common affairs of life, by a precise, general
rule."<a name="fn_10r" id="fn_10r"></a><a href="#fn_10"><sup><span class="small">10</span></sup></a> The genuine effusions of the heart and mind are easily
distinguished, by the penetrating eye, from the vain ostentation of
sentiment, lip deep, which, causing no emotion, communicates
none&mdash;Oh! how unlike the energetic sympathies of truth and
feeling&mdash;darting from mind to mind, enlightening, warming, with
electrical rapidity!</p>

<p>'My ideas have undergone, in the last three months, many
fluctuations. My <i>affection</i> for you (why should I seek for vague,
inexpressive phrases?) has not ceased, has not diminished, but it
has, in some measure, changed its nature. It was originally
generated by the report, and cemented by the knowledge, of your
virtues and talents; and to virtue and talents my mind had ever paid
unfeigned, enthusiastic, homage! It is somewhere said by Rousseau&mdash;"That
there may exist such a suitability of moral, mental, and
personal, qualifications, as should point out the propriety of an
union between a prince and the daughter of an executioner." Vain
girl that I was! I flattered myself that between us this sympathy
really existed. I dwelt on the union between mind and mind&mdash;sentiments
of nature gently insinuated themselves&mdash;my sensibility
grew more tender, more affecting&mdash;and my imagination, ever
lively, traced the glowing picture, and dipped the pencil in rainbow
tints! Possessing one of those determined spirits, that is not easily
induced to relinquish its purposes&mdash;while I conceived that I had
only your pride, or your insensibility, to combat, I wildly
determined to persevere.&mdash;A further recapitulation would,
perhaps, be unnecessary:&mdash;my situation, alas! is now changed.</p>

<p>'Having then examined my heart, attentively and deliberately, I
suspect that I have been unjust to myself, in supposing it incapable
of a disinterested attachment.&mdash;Why am I to deprive you of a
faithful friend, and myself of all the benefits I may yet derive from
your conversation and kind offices? I ask, why? And I should,
indeed, have cause to blush, if, after having had time for reflection,
I could really think this necessary. Shall I, then, sign the unjust
decree, that women are incapable of energy and fortitude? Have I
exercised my understanding, without ever intending to apply my
principles to practice? Do I mean always to deplore the prejudices
which have, systematically, weakened the female character, without
making any effort to rise above them? Is the example you have
given me, of a steady adherence to honour and principle, to be
merely respected, without exciting in my bosom any emulation?
Dare I to answer these questions in the affirmative, and still ask
your esteem&mdash;the esteem of the wise and good?&mdash;I dare not! No
longer weakened by alternate hopes and fears, like the reed
yielding to every breeze, I believe myself capable of acting upon
firmer principles; and I request, with confidence, the restoration of
your friendship! Should I afterwards find, that I have over-rated
my own strength, I will frankly tell you so, and expect from your
humanity those allowances, which are but a poor substitute for
respect.</p>

<p>'Believe, then, my views and motives to be simply such as I state
them; at least, such, after severely scrutinizing my heart, they
appear to myself; and reply to me with similar ingenuousness. My
expectations are very moderate: answer me with simplicity&mdash;my
very soul sickens at evasion! You have undoubtedly, a right to
judge and to determine for yourself; but it will be but just to state
to me the reasons for, and the result of, that judgment; in which
case, if I cannot obviate those reasons, I shall be bound, however
reluctantly, to acquiesce in them. Be assured, I will never complain
of any consequences which may ensue, even, from the utterance of
all truth.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_IIIa" id="ch_IIIa"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>This letter was succeeded by a renewal of our intercourse and
studies. Mrs Denbeigh, my kind hostess, was usually of our parties.
We read together, or conversed only on general topics, or upon
subjects of literature. I was introduced by Mr Harley to several
respectable families, friends of his own and of his mother's. I made
many indirect enquiries of our common acquaintance, with a view to
discover the supposed object of my friend's attachment, but without
success. All that he had, himself, said, respecting such an
engagement, had been so vague, that I began to doubt of the reality
of its existence.&mdash;When, in any subsequent letters (for we continued
occasionally to correspond) I ventured to allude to the subject, I was
warned 'not to confound my own conceptions with real existences.'
When he spoke of a susceptibility to the tender affections, it was
always in the past time,&mdash;'I <i>have</i> felt,'&mdash;'I <i>have</i> been&mdash;'Once he
wrote&mdash;'His situation had been rendered difficult, by a combination
of <i>peculiar circumstances</i>; circumstances, with which but few persons
were acquainted.' Sometimes he would affect to reflect upon his past
conduct, and warn me against appreciating him too highly. In fine, he
was a perfect enigma, and every thing which he said or wrote tended
to increase the mystery.</p>

<p>A restless, an insatiable, curiosity, devoured me, heightened by
feelings that every hour became more imperious, more uncontroulable.
I proposed to myself, in the gratification of this curiosity, a
satisfaction that should compensate for all the injuries I might suffer
in the career. This inquietude prevented my mind from resting; and,
by leaving room for conjecture, left room for the illusions of fancy,
and of hope. Had I never expressed this, he might have affected
ignorance of my sensations; he might have pleaded guiltless, when, in
the agony of my soul, I accused him of having sacrificed my peace to
his disingenuousness&mdash;but vain were all my expostulations!</p>

<p>'If,' said I, 'I have sought, too earnestly, to learn the state of your
affections, it has been with a view to the more effectually disciplining
of my own&mdash;of stifling every <i>ignis fatuus</i> of false hope, that making,
even, impossibilities possible, will still, at times, continue to mislead
me. Objects seen through obscurity, imperfectly discerned, allow to
the fancy but too free a scope; the mind grows debilitated, by
brooding over its apprehensions; and those apprehensions, whether
real or imaginary, are carried with accumulated pain to the heart. I
have said, on this subject, you have a right to be free; but I am, now,
doubtful of this right: the health of my mind being involved in the
question, has rendered it a question of <i>utility</i>&mdash;and on what other
basis can morals rest?'</p>

<p>I frequently reiterated these reasonings, always with encreased
fervor and earnestness: represented&mdash;'that every step I took in
advance would be miles in return&mdash;every minute that the blow was
suspended, prepared it to descend with accumulated force.' I
required no particulars, but merely requested to be assured of <i>a
present, existing, engagement</i>. I continued, from time to time, to urge
this subject.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Much,' said I, 'as I esteem you, and deeply as a thousand
associations have fixed your idea in my heart&mdash;in true candour of
soul, I, yet, feel myself your superior.&mdash;I recollect a sentiment of
Richardson's Clarissa that always pleased me, and that may afford
a test, by which each of us may judge of the integrity of our own
minds&mdash;"I should be glad that you, and all the world, knew my
heart; let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions; fairly
scanned, I fear not the result. Let them ask me my most secret
thoughts; and, whether they make for me, or against me, I will
reveal them."</p>

<p>'This is the principle, my friend, upon which I have acted
towards you. I have said many things, I doubt not, which make
against me; but I trusted them to one, who told me, that he had
made the human heart his study: and it is only in compliance with
the prejudices of others, if I have taken any pains to conceal all I
have thought and felt on this, or on any other, subject, from the
rest of the world. Had I not, in the wild career of fervent feeling,
had sufficient strength of mind to stop short, and to reason calmly,
how often, in the bitterness of my spirit, should I have accused you
of sporting with my feelings, by involving me in a hopeless maze of
conjecture&mdash;by leaving me a prey to the constant, oppressive,
apprehension of hearing something, which I should not have had
the fortitude to support with dignity; which, in proportion as it is
delayed, still contributes to harrass, to weaken, to incapacitate, my
mind from bearing its disclosure.</p>

<p>'I know you might reply&mdash;and more than nine-tenths of the
world would justify you in this reply&mdash;"That you had already said,
what ought to have been sufficient, and would have been so to any
other human being;&mdash;that you had not sought the confidence I
boast of having reposed in you;&mdash;and that so far from affording
you any satisfaction, it has occasioned you only perplexity. If my own
destiny was not equivocal, of what importance could it be to me,
and what right had I to enquire after circumstances, in which,
however affecting, I could have no real concern."</p>

<p>'You may think all this, perhaps&mdash;I will not spare myself&mdash;and it
may be reasonable. <i>But could you say it</i>&mdash;and have you, indeed,
studied the human heart&mdash;<i>have you, indeed, ever felt the affections?</i>&mdash;Whatever
may be the event&mdash;and it is in the mind of powers only
that passions are likely to become fatal&mdash;and however irreproachable
every other part of your conduct may have been, I shall, <i>here</i>,
always say, you were culpable!'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I changed my style.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I know not,' said I, 'the nature of those stern duties, which oblige
you to with-hold from me your tenderness; neither do I any longer
enquire. I dread, only, lest I should acquire this knowledge when I
am the least able to support it. Ignorant, then, of any reasons which
should prevent me from giving up my heart to an attachment, now
become interwoven with my existence, I yield myself up to these
sweet and affecting emotions, so necessary to my disposition&mdash;to
which apathy is abhorrent. "The affections (truly says Sterne) must
be exercised on something; for, not to love, is to be miserable.
Were I in a desart, I would find out wherewith in it to call forth my
affections. If I could do no better, I would fasten them upon some
sweet myrtle, or seek some melancholy cypress to connect myself
to&mdash;I would court their shade, and greet them kindly for their
protection. I would cut my name upon them, and swear they were
the loveliest trees throughout the desart. If their leaves withered, I
would teach myself to mourn; and, when they rejoiced, I would
rejoice with them."</p>

<p>'An attachment, founded upon a full conviction of worth, must
be both safe and salutary. My mind has not sufficient strength to
form an abstract idea of perfection. I have ever found it stimulated,
improved, advanced, by its affections. I will, then, continue to love
you with fervor and purity; I will see you with joy, part from you
with regret, grieve in your griefs, enter with zeal into your
concerns, interest myself in your honour and welfare, and
endeavour, with all my little power, to contribute to your comfort
and satisfaction.&mdash;Is your heart so differently constituted from
every other human heart, that an affection, thus ardent and
sincere, excites in it no grateful, and soothing, emotions? Why,
then, withdraw yourself from me, and by that means afflict, and
sink into despondency, a mind that entrusts its peace to your
keeping.</p>

<p>We met the next day at the house of a common friend. My accents,
involuntarily, were softened, my attentions pointed.&mdash;Manifestly
agitated, embarrassed, even distressed, Augustus quitted the company
at an early hour.</p>

<p>It would be endless to enumerate all the little incidents that
occurred; which, however trifling they might appear in the recital,
continued to operate in one direction. Many letters passed to the
same purport. My curiosity was a consuming passion; but this
inflexible, impenetrable, man, was still silent, or alternately evaded,
and resented, my enquiries. We continued, occasionally, to meet, but
generally in company.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_IVa" id="ch_IVa"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>During the ensuing summer, Mr Harley proposed making a visit to
his mother, and, calling to take his leave of me, on the evening
preceding his journey, accidentally found me alone.&mdash;We entered
into conversation on various subjects: twilight stole upon us
unperceived. The obscure light inspired me with courage: I ventured
to resume a subject, so often discussed; I complained, gently, of his
reserve.</p>

<p>'Could I suppose,' he asked, 'that he had been without <i>his share</i> of
suffering?'</p>

<p>I replied something, I scarce know what, adverting to his stronger
mind.</p>

<p>'Strength!' said he, turning from me with emotion, 'rather say,
weakness!'</p>

<p>I reiterated the important, the so often proposed, enquiry&mdash;'Had
he, or had he not, a <i>present, existing, engagement</i>?'</p>

<p>He endeavoured to evade my question&mdash;I repeated it&mdash;He
answered, with a degree of impatience, '<i>I cannot tell you</i>; if I could, do
you think I would have been silent so long?'&mdash;as once, before, he
spoke of the circumstances of his past life, as being of '<i>a singular, a
peculiar, nature</i>.'</p>

<p>At our separation, I asked, if he would write to me during his
absence. 'Certainly, he would.' The next morning, having some little
commissions to execute for Mrs Harley, I sent them, accompanied by
a few lines, to her son.</p>

<p>'Why is it,' said I, 'that our sagacity, and penetration, frequently
desert us on the most interesting occasions? I can read any mind with
greater facility than I can read your's; and, yet, what other have I so
attentively studied? This is a problem I know not how to solve. One
conclusion will force itself upon me&mdash;if a mistaken one, whom have
you to blame?&mdash;That an <i>honourable</i>, suitable, engagement, could have
given no occasion for mystery.' I added, 'I should depend on hearing
from him, according to his promise.'</p>

<p>Week after week, month after month, wore away, and no letter
arrived. Perturbation was succeeded by anxiety and apprehension;
but hearing, through my maternal friend, Mrs Harley, of the welfare
of this object of our too tender cares, my solicitude subsided into
despondency. The pressure of one corroding train of ideas preyed,
like a canker-worm, upon my heart, and destroyed all its tranquillity.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the winter, this mysterious, inexplicable, being,
again returned to town. I had undertaken a little business, to serve
him, during his absence&mdash;I transmitted to him an account of my
proceedings; subjoining a gentle reproach for his unkind silence.</p>

<p>'You promised you would write to me,' said I, 'during your
residence in &mdash;&mdash;shire. I therefore depended upon hearing from you;
and, yet, I was disappointed. You should not, indeed you should not,
make these experiments upon my mind. My sensibility, originally
acute, from having been too much exercised, has become nearly
morbid, and has almost unfitted me for an inhabitant of this world. I
am willing to believe, that your conduct towards me has originated in
good motives, nevertheless, you have made some sad mistakes&mdash;you
have <i>deeply</i>, though undesignedly, wounded me: I have been
harrassed, distressed, mortified. You know not, neither will I attempt
to describe, all I have suffered! language would be inadequate to
paint the struggles of a delicate, susceptible, mind, in some peculiar
and interesting situations.</p>

<p>'You may suspect me of wanting resolution, but strong, persevering
affections, are no mark of a weak mind. To have been the wife of a
man of virtue and talents was my dearest ambition, and would have
been my glory: I judged myself worthy of the confidence and
affection of such a man&mdash;I felt, that I could have united in his
pursuits, and shared his principles&mdash;aided the virtuous energies of
his mind, and assured his domestic comforts. I earnestly sought to
inspire you with tenderness, from the conviction, that I could
contribute to your happiness, and to the worth of your character. And
if, from innumerable associations, I at length loved your person, it
was the magnanimity of your conduct, it was your virtues, that first
excited my admiration and esteem. But you have rejected an attachment
originating in the highest, the purest, principles&mdash;you have
thrown from you a heart of exquisite sensibility, and you leave me in
doubt, whether you have not sacrificed that heart to prejudice. Yet,
contemned affection has excited in my mind no resentment; true
tenderness is made up of gentle and amiable emotions; nothing
hostile, nothing severe, can mix with it: it may gradually subside, but
it will continue to soften the mind it has once subdued.</p>

<p>'I see much to respect in your conduct, and though, it is probable,
some parts of it may have originated in mistaken principles, I trust,
that their source was pure! I, also, have made many mistakes&mdash;have
been guilty of many extravagances. Yet, distrust the morality, that
sternly commands you to pierce the bosom that most reveres you, and
then to call it virtue&mdash;<i>Yes! distrust and suspect its origin!</i>' I concluded
with expressing a wish to see him&mdash;'<i>merely as a friend</i>'&mdash;requesting a
line in reply.</p>

<p>He wrote not, but came, unexpectedly came, the next evening. I
expressed, in lively terms, the pleasure I felt in seeing him. We
conversed on various subjects, he spoke affectionately of his mother,
and of the tender interest she had expressed for my welfare. He
enquired after my pursuits and acquirements during his absence,
commending the progress I had made. Just before he quitted me, he
adverted to the reproach I had made him, for not having written to
me, according to his engagement.</p>

<p>'Recollect,' said he, 'in the last letter I received from you, before I
left London, you hinted some suspicions&mdash;' I looked at him, 'and
what,' added he, 'could I reply?'</p>

<p>I was disconcerted, I changed colour, and had no power to pursue
the subject.</p>

<p>From this period, he continued to visit me (I confess at my
solicitation) more frequently. We occasionally resumed our scientific
pursuits, read together, or entered into discussion on various topics.
At length he grew captious, disputatious, gloomy, and imperious&mdash;the
more I studied to please him, the less I succeeded. He
disapproved my conduct, my opinions, my sentiments; my frankness
offended him. This change considerably affected me. In company,
his manners were studiously cold and distant; in private capricious,
yet reserved and guarded. He seemed to overlook all my efforts to
please, and, with a severe and penetrating eye, to search only for my
errors&mdash;errors, into which I was but too easily betrayed, by the
painful, and delicate, situation, in which I had placed myself.</p>

<p>We, one day, accompanied Mrs Denbeigh on a visit of
congratulation to her brother (eldest son of my deceased uncle Mr
Melmoth), who had, when a youth, been placed by his father in a
commercial house in the West Indies, and who had just returned to
his native country with an ample fortune. His sister and myself
anticipated the pleasure of renewing our early, fraternal, affection
and intimacy, while I felt a secret pride in introducing to his
acquaintance a man so accomplished and respectable as Mr Harley.
We were little aware of the changes which time and different
situations produce on the character, and, with hearts and minds full
of the frank, lively, affectionate, youth, from whom we had parted,
seven years since, with mutual tears and embraces, shrunk
spontaneously, on our arrival at Mr Melmoth's elegant house in
Bedford square, from the cold salutation, of the haughty, opulent,
purse-proud, Planter, surrounded by ostentatious luxuries, and
evidently valuing himself upon the consequence which he imagined
they must give him in our eyes.</p>

<p>Mr Harley received the formal compliments of this favourite of
fortune with the easy politeness which distinguishes the gentleman
and the man of letters, and the dignified composure which the
consciousness of worth and talents seldom fails to inspire. Mr
Melmoth, by his awkward and embarrassed manner, tacitly acknowledged
the impotence of wealth and the real superiority of his guest.
We were introduced by our stately relation to his wife, the lady of the
mansion, a young woman whom he had accidentally met with in a
party of pleasure at Jamaica, whither she had attended a family in the
humble office of companion or chief attendant to the lady. Fascinated
by her beauty and lively manner, our trader had overlooked an empty
mind, a low education, and a doubtful character, and, after a very few
interviews, tendered to her acceptance his hand and fortune; which,
though not without some affectation of doubt and delay, were in a
short time joyfully accepted.</p>

<p>A gentleman joined our party in the dining-room, whom the
servant announced by the name of Pemberton, in whom I presently
recognized, notwithstanding some years had elapsed since our former
meeting, the man of fashon and gallantry who had been the
antagonist of Mr Francis, at the table of my father. He had lately (we
were informed by our host) been to Jamaica, to take possession of an
estate bequeathed to him, and had returned to England in the same
vessel with Mr and Mrs Melmoth. After an elegant dinner of several
courses had been served up and removed for the desert, a desultory
conversation took place.</p>

<p>Mr Pemberton, it appeared, held a commission in the militia, and
earnestly solicited Mrs Melmoth, on whom he lavished a profusion of
compliments, to grace their encampment, which was to be stationed
in the ensuing season near one of the fashionable watering places,
with her presence.</p>

<p>This request the lady readily promised to comply with, expressing,
in tones of affected softness, her admiration of military men, and
of the</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">
'Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!'
</p>
</div>

<p>'Do you not think, Miss Courtney,' said she, turning to me, 'that
soldiers are the most agreeable and charming men in the world?'</p>

<p>'Indeed I do not, Madam; their trade is <i>murder</i>, and their
trappings, in my eyes, appear but as the gaudy pomp of sacrifice.'</p>

<p>'<i>Murder</i>, indeed! What a harsh word&mdash;I declare you are a shocking
creature&mdash;There have always been wars in the world, and there
always must be: but surely you would not confound the brave fellows,
who fight to protect their King and Country, and <i>the ladies</i>, with
common ruffians and housebreakers!'</p>

<p>'All the difference between them is, that the one, rendered
desperate by passion, poverty, or injustice, endeavours by <i>wrong</i>
means to do himself <i>right</i>, and through this terrible and pitiable
mistake destroys the life or the property of a fellow being&mdash;The
others, wantonly and in cold blood, cut down millions of their
species, ravage whole towns and cities, and carry devastation through
a country.'</p>

<p>'What <i>odd notions</i>! Dear, Mr Pemberton, did you ever hear a lady
talk so strangely?'</p>

<p>Thus called upon, Mr Pemberton thought it incumbent upon him
to interfere&mdash;'<i>Courtney</i>, I think, Madam, your name is! The daughter
of an old friend of mine, if I am not mistaken, and who, I remember,
was, when a very young lady, a great admirer of <i>Roman virtues</i>.'</p>

<p>'Not of <i>Roman virtues</i>, I believe, Sir; they had in them too much of
the destructive spirit which Mrs Melmoth thinks so admirable.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I said nothing about <i>Roman virtues</i>, nor do I trouble myself
with such subjects&mdash;I merely admired the soldiers because they are
so brave and so polite; besides, the military dress is so elegant and
becoming&mdash;Dear, Mr Pemberton, how charmingly you must look in
your regimentals!'</p>

<p>Mr Pemberton, bowing in return to the compliment, made an
animated eulogium on the taste and beauty of the speaker.</p>

<p>'Pray, Sir,' resumed she, addressing herself to Mr Harley, whose
inattention seemed to pique her, and whose notice she was
determined to attract, 'are you of Miss Courtney's opinion&mdash;do you
think it right to call soldiers <i>murderers</i>?'</p>

<p>'Upon my word, Madam,' with an air of irony, 'you must excuse
me from entering into such <i>nice distinctions</i>&mdash;when <i>ladies</i> differ, who
shall presume to decide?'</p>

<p>Mr Melmoth interposed, by wishing, 'that they had some
thousands more of these <i>murderers</i> in the West Indies, to keep the
slaves in subordination, who, since absurd notions of liberty had been
put into their heads, were grown very troublesome and refractory,
and, in a short time, he supposed, would become as insolent as the
English servants.'</p>

<p>'Would you believe it, Mrs Denbeigh,' said the Planter's lady,
addressing the sister of her husband, 'Mr Melmoth and I have been
in England but a month, and have been obliged three times to change
our whole suit of servants?'</p>

<p>'This is a land of freedom, my dear sister; servants, here, will not
submit to be treated like the slaves of Jamaica.'</p>

<p>'Well, I am sure it is very provoking to have one's will disputed by
such low, ignorant, creatures. How should they know what is right? It
is enough for them to obey the orders of their superiors.'</p>

<p>'But suppose,' replied Mrs Denbeigh, 'they should happen to think
their superiors unreasonable!'</p>

<p>'<i>Think!</i> sister,' said the lordly Mr Melmoth, with an exulting laugh,
'what have <i>servants</i>, or <i>women</i>, to do with <i>thinking</i>?'</p>

<p>'Nay, now,' interrupted Mr Pemberton, 'you are too severe upon
the ladies&mdash;how would the elegant and tasteful arrangement of Mrs
Melmoth's ornaments have been produced without thinking?'</p>

<p>'Oh, you flatterer!' said the lady. 'Let them think only about
their dress, and I have no objection, but don't let them plague us with
<i>sermonizing</i>.'</p>

<p>'Mrs Melmoth,' said I, coolly, 'does not often, I dare say, offend <i>in
this way</i>. That some of the gentlemen, present, should object to a
woman's exercising her discriminating powers, is not wonderful,
since it might operate greatly to their disadvantage.'</p>

<p>'A blow on the right cheek, from so fair a hand,' replied Mr
Pemberton, affectedly bending his body, 'would almost induce one to
adopt the christian maxim, and turn the left, also. What say you, Mr
Harley?'</p>

<p>'Mr Harley, I believe, Sir, does not feel himself included in the
reflection.'</p>

<p>'He is a happy man then.'</p>

<p>'No, Sir, merely a <i>rational one</i>!'</p>

<p>'You are pleased to be severe; of all things I dread a female wit.'</p>

<p>'It is an instinctive feeling of self-preservation&mdash;nature provides
weak animals with timidity as a guard.'</p>

<p>Mr Pemberton reddened, and, affecting a careless air, hummed a
tune. Mr Melmoth again reverted to the subject of English servants,
which gave rise to a discussion on the Slave Trade. Mr Harley
pleaded the cause of freedom and humanity with a bold and manly
eloquence, expatiating warmly on the iniquity as well as impolicy of
so accursed a traffic. Melmoth was awed into silence. Mr Pemberton
advanced some trite arguments in opposition, respecting the
temporary mischiefs which might ensue, in case of an abolition, to
the planters, landholders, traders, &amp;c. Augustus explained, by
contending only for the gradual emancipation, after their minds had
been previously prepared, of the oppressed Africans. The conversation
grew interesting. Pemberton was not devoid of talents when he
laid aside his affectation; the subject was examined both in a moral
and a political point of view. I listened with delight, while Augustus
exposed and confuted the specious reasoning and sophistry of his
antagonist: exulting in the triumph of truth and justice, I secretly
gloried&mdash;'with more than selfish vanity'&mdash;in the virtues and abilities
of my friend. Though driven from all his resources, Mr Pemberton
was too much the courtier to be easily disconcerted, but complimenting
his adversary on his eloquence, declared he should be happy to
hear of his having a seat in Parliament.</p>

<p>Mrs Melmoth, who had yawned and betrayed various symptoms of
weariness during the discussion, now proposed the adjournment of
the ladies into the drawing-room, whither I was compelled, by a
barbarous and odious custom, reluctantly to follow, and to submit to
be entertained with a torrent of folly and impertinence.</p>

<p>'I was ill-natured,' she told me.&mdash;'How could I be so severe upon
the <i>charming</i> and <i>elegant</i> Mr Pemberton?'</p>

<p>It was in vain I laboured to convince her, that to be treated like
ideots was no real compliment, and that the men who condescend to
flatter our foibles, despised the weak beings they helped to form.</p>

<p>My remonstrances were as fatiguing, and as little to be
comprehended by this <i>fine lady</i>, as the arguments respecting the Slave
Trade:&mdash;she sought refuge from them in interrogating Mrs
Denbeigh respecting the last new fashions, and in consulting her
taste on the important question&mdash;whether blue or violet colour was
the most becoming to a brunette complexion? The gentlemen joined
us, to our great relief, at the tea-table:&mdash;other company dropped in,
and the evening was beguiled with cards and the chess-board;&mdash;at
the latter Mr Melmoth and Mr Harley were antagonists;&mdash;the former
was no match for Augustus. I amused myself by observing their
moves, and overlooking the game.</p>

<p>During our return from this visit, some conversation occurred
between Mr Harley, my cousin, and myself, respecting the company
we had quitted. I expressed my disappointment, disgust, and
contempt, in terms, it may be, a little too strong.</p>

<p>'I was <i>fastidious</i>,' Augustus told me, 'I wanted a world made on
purpose for me, and beings formed after one model. It was both
amusing, and instructive, to contemplate varieties of character. I was
a romantic enthusiast&mdash;and should endeavour to become more like
an inhabitant of the world.'</p>

<p>Piqued at these remarks, and at the tone and manner in which they
were uttered, I felt my temper rising, and replied with warmth; but it
was the glow of a moment; for, to say truth, vexation and
disappointment, rather than reason, had broken and subdued my
spirit. Mrs Denbeigh, perceiving I was pained, kindly endeavoured to
give a turn to the conversation; yet she could not help expressing her
regret, on observing the folly, levity, and extravagance, of the woman
whom her brother had chosen for a wife.</p>

<p>'No doubt,' said Augustus, a little peevishly, 'he is fond of her&mdash;she
is a fine woman&mdash;there is no accounting for the <i>caprices</i> of the
affections.'</p>

<p>I sighed, and my eyes filled with tears&mdash;'Is, then, affection so
<i>capricious</i> a sentiment&mdash;is it possible to love what we despise?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell,' retorted Mr Harley, with quickness. 'Triflers can
give no <i>serious</i> occasion for uneasiness:&mdash;the humours of superior
women are sometimes still less tolerable.'</p>

<p>'Ah! how unjust. If gentleness be not <i>the perfection of reason</i>, it is a
quality which I have never, yet, properly understood.'</p>

<p>He made no reply, but sunk into silence, reserve, and reverie. On
our arrival at my apartments, I ventured (my cousin having left us) to
expostulate with him on his unkind behaviour; but was answered with
severity. Some retrospection ensued, which gradually led to the
subject ever present to my thoughts.&mdash;Again I expressed a solicitude
to be informed of the real state of his heart, of the nature of those
mysterious obstacles, to which, when clearly ascertained, I was ready
to submit.&mdash;'Had he, or had he not, an attachment, that looked to, as
its <i>end</i>, a serious and legal engagement?' He appeared ruffled and
discomposed.&mdash;'I ought not to be so urgent&mdash;he had already sufficiently
explained himself.' He then repeated to me some particulars,
apparently adverse to such a supposition&mdash;asking me, in his turn,
'If these circumstances bespoke his having any such event in view?'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_VIa" id="ch_VIa"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>For some time after this he absented himself from me; and, when he
returned, his manners were still more unequal; even his sentiments,
and principles, at times, appeared to me equivocal, and his character
seemed wholly changed. I tried, in vain, to accommodate myself to a
disposition so various. My affection, my sensibility, my fear of
offending&mdash;a thousand conflicting, torturing, emotions, threw a
constraint over my behaviour.&mdash;My situation became absolutely
intolerable&mdash;time was murdered, activity vain, virtue inefficient: yet, a
secret hope inspired me, that <i>indifference</i> could not have produced the
irritations, the inequalities, that thus harrassed me. I thought, I
observed a conflict in his mind; his fits of absence, and reflection,
were unusual, deep, and frequent: I watched them with anxiety, with
terror, with breathless expectation. My health became affected, and
my mind disordered. I perceived that it was impossible to proceed, in
the manner we had hitherto done, much longer&mdash;I felt that it would,
inevitably, destroy me.</p>

<p>I reflected, meditated, reasoned, with myself&mdash;'That one channel,
into which my thoughts were incessantly impelled, was destructive of
all order, of all connection.' New projects occurred to me, which I
had never before ventured to encourage&mdash;I revolved them in my
mind, examined them in every point of view, weighed their
advantages and disadvantages, in a moral, in a prudential, scale.&mdash;Threatening
evils appeared on all sides&mdash;I endeavoured, at once, to
free my mind from prejudice, and from passion; and, in the critical
and <i>singular</i> circumstances in which I had placed myself, coolly to
survey the several arguments of the case, and nicely to calculate their
force and importance.</p>

<p>'If, as we are taught to believe, the benevolent Author of nature be,
indeed, benevolent,' said I, to myself, 'he surely must have intended
the <i>happiness</i> of his creatures. Our morality cannot extend to him, but
must consist in the knowledge, and practice, of those duties which we
owe to ourselves and to each other.&mdash;Individual happiness constitutes
the general good:&mdash;<i>happiness</i> is the only true <i>end</i> of existence;&mdash;all
notions of morals, founded on any other principle, involve in
themselves a contradiction, and must be erroneous. Man does right,
when pursuing interest and pleasure&mdash;it argues no depravity&mdash;this is
the fable of superstition: he ought to only be careful, that, in seeking
his own good, he does not render it incompatible with the good of
others&mdash;that he does not consider himself as standing alone in the
universe. The infraction of established <i>rules</i> may, it is possible, in
some cases, be productive of mischief; yet, it is difficult to state any
<i>rule</i> so precise and determinate, as to be alike applicable to every
situation: what, in one instance, might be a <i>vice</i>, in another may
possibly become a <i>virtue</i>:&mdash;a thousand imperceptible, evanescent,
shadings, modify every thought, every motive, every action, of our
lives&mdash;no one can estimate the sensations of, can form an exact
judgment for, another.</p>

<p>'I have sometimes suspected, that all mankind are pursuing
phantoms, however dignified by different appellations.&mdash;The healing
operations of time, had I patience to wait the experiment, might,
perhaps, recover my mind from its present distempered state; but, in
the meanwhile, the bloom of youth is fading, and the vigour of life
running to waste.&mdash;Should I, at length, awake from a delusive vision,
it would be only to find myself a comfortless, solitary, shivering,
wanderer, in the dreary wilderness of human society. I feel in myself
the capacities for increasing the happiness, and the improvement, of a
few individuals&mdash;and this circle, spreading wider and wider, would
operate towards the grand end of life&mdash;<i>general utility</i>.'</p>

<p>Again I repeated to myself&mdash;'Ascetic virtues are equally barbarous
as vain:&mdash;the only just morals, are those which have a tendency to
increase the bulk of enjoyment. My plan tends to this. The good
which I seek does not appear to me to involve injury to any one&mdash;it is
of a nature, adapted to the disposition of my mind, for which every
event of my life, the education both of design and accident, have
fitted me. If I am now put out, I may, perhaps, do mischief:&mdash;the
placid stream, forced from its channel, lays waste the meadow. I seem
to stand as upon a wide plain, bounded on all sides by the horizon:&mdash;among
the objects which I perceive within these limits, some are so
lofty, my eyes ache to look up to them; others so low, I disdain to
stoop for them. <i>One</i>, only, seems fitted to my powers, and to my
wishes&mdash;<i>one, alone</i>, engages my attention! Is not its possession worthy
an arduous effort: <i>Perseverance</i> can turn the course of rivers, and level
mountains! Shall I, then, relinquish my efforts, when, perhaps, on the
very verge of success?</p>

<p>'The mind must have an object:&mdash;should I desist from my present
pursuit, after all it has cost me, for what can I change it? I feel, that I
am neither a philosopher, nor a heroine&mdash;but a <i>woman, to whom
education has given a sexual character</i>. It is true, I have risen superior to
the generality of my <i>oppressed sex</i>; yet, I have neither the talents for a
legislator, nor for a reformer, of the world. I have still many female
foibles, and shrinking delicacies, that unfit me for rising to arduous
heights. Ambition cannot stimulate me, and to accumulate wealth, I
am still less fitted. Should I, then, do violence to my heart, and
compel it to resign its hopes and expectations, what can preserve me
from sinking into, the most abhorred of all states, <i>languor and inanity</i>?&mdash;Alas!
that tender and faithful heart refuses to change its object&mdash;it
can never love another. Like Rousseau's Julia, my strong individual
attachment has annihilated every man in the creation:&mdash;him I love
appears, in my eyes, something more&mdash;every other, something less.</p>

<p>'I have laboured to improve myself, that I might be worthy of the
situation I have chosen. I would unite myself to a man of worth&mdash;I
would have our mingled virtues and talents perpetuated in our
offspring&mdash;I would experience those sweet sensations, of which
nature has formed my heart so exquisitely susceptible. My ardent
sensibilities incite me to love&mdash;to seek to inspire sympathy&mdash;to be
beloved! My heart obstinately refuses to renounce the man, to whose
mind my own seems akin! From the centre of private affections, it
will at length embrace&mdash;like spreading circles on the peaceful bosom
of the smooth and expanded lake&mdash;the whole sensitive and rational
creation. Is it virtue, then, to combat, or to yield to, my passions?'</p>

<p>I considered, and reconsidered, these reasonings, so specious, so
flattering, to which passion lent its force. One moment, my mind
seemed firmly made up on the part I had to act;&mdash;I persuaded
myself, that I had gone too far to recede, and that there remained for
me no alternative:&mdash;the next instant, I shrunk, gasping, from my own
resolves, and shuddered at the important consequences which they
involved. Amidst a variety of perturbations, of conflicting emotions, I,
at length, once more, took up my pen.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_VIIa" id="ch_VIIa"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'I blush, when I reflect what a weak, wavering, inconsistent being,
I must lately have appeared to you. I write to you on important
subjects&mdash;I forbid you to answer me on paper; and, when you
seem inclined to put that period to the present, painful, high-wrought,
and trying, state of my feelings, which is now become so
necessary, I appear neither to hear, nor to comprehend you. I fly
from the subject, and thicken the cloud of mystery, of which I have
so often, and, I still think, so justly complained.&mdash;These are some
of the effects of the contradictory systems, that have so long
bewildered our principles and conduct. A combination of causes,
added to the conflict between a thousand delicate and nameless
emotions, have lately conspired to confuse, to weaken, my spirits.
You can conceive, that these acute, mental, sensations, must have
had a temporary effect on the state of my health. To say truth (and,
had I not said it, my countenance would have betrayed me), I have
not, for some time past, been so thoroughly disordered.</p>

<p>'Once more, I have determined to rally my strength; for I feel,
that a much longer continuance in the situation, in which my mind
has been lately involved, would be insupportable:&mdash;and I call upon
you, <i>now</i>, with a resolution to summon all my fortitude to bear the
result, for the <i>written</i> state of your mind, on the topic become so
important to my future welfare and usefulness.</p>

<p>'You may suppose, that a mind like mine must have, repeatedly,
set itself to examine, on every side, all that could possibly have a
relation to a subject affecting it so materially. You have hinted at
<i>mysterious</i> obstacles to the wish, in which every faculty of my soul
has been so long absorbed&mdash;the wish of forming with you, a
connection, nearer, <i>and more tender</i>, than that of friendship. This
mystery, by leaving room for conjecture (and how frequently have I
warned you of this!), left room for the illusions of imagination, and
of hope&mdash;left room for the suspicion, that you might, possibly, be
sacrificing <i>your own feelings</i> as well as mine, to a mistaken principle.
Is it possible that you were not aware of this&mdash;you, who are not
unacquainted with the nature of the mind! Still less were you
ignorant of the nature of my mind&mdash;which I had so explicitly, so
unreservedly, laid open! I had a double claim upon your
confidence&mdash;a confidence, that I was utterly incapable of abusing,
or betraying&mdash;a confidence, which must have stopped my mind in
its career&mdash;which would have saved me the bitter, agonizing, pangs
I have sustained. Mine were not common feelings&mdash;it is <i>obscurity</i>
and <i>mystery</i> which has wrought them up to frenzy&mdash;<i>truth</i> and
<i>certainty</i> would, long ere this, have caused them temporarily to
subside into their accustomed channels. You understand little of
the human heart, if you cannot conceive this&mdash;"Where the
imagination is vivid, the feelings strong, the views and desires not
bounded by common rules;&mdash;in such minds, passions, if not
subdued, become ungovernable and fatal: where there is much
warmth, much enthusiasm, there is much danger.&mdash;My mind is no
less ardent than yours, though education and habit may have given
it a different turn&mdash;it glows with equal zeal to attain its end."<a name="fn_11r" id="fn_11r"></a><a href="#fn_11"><sup><span class="small">11</span></sup></a> Yes,
I must continue to repeat, there has been in your conduct <i>one grand
mistake</i>; and the train of consequences which may, yet, ensue, are
uncertain, and threatening.&mdash;But, I mean no reproach&mdash;we are all
liable to errors; and my own, I feel, are many, and various. But to
return&mdash;</p>

<p>'You may suppose I have revolved, in my thoughts, every
possible difficulty on the subject alluded to; balancing their degrees
of probability and force:&mdash;and, I will frankly confess, such is the
sanguine ardour of my temper, that I can conceive but one
obstacle, that would be <i>absolutely invincible</i>; which is, supposing that
you have already contracted a <i>legal, irrecoverable</i>, engagement. Yet,
this I do not suppose. I will arrange, under five heads, (on all
occasions, I love to class and methodize) every other possible
species of objection, and subjoin all the reasonings which have
occurred to me on the subjects.</p>

<p>'And, first, I will imagine, as the most serious and threatening
difficulty, that you love another. I would, then, ask&mdash;Is she capable
of estimating your worth&mdash;does she love you&mdash;has she the
magnanimity to tell you so&mdash;would she sacrifice to that affection
every meaner consideration&mdash;has she the merit to secure, as well
as accomplishments to attract, your regard?&mdash;You are too well
acquainted with the human heart, not to be aware, that what is
commonly called love is of a fleeting nature, kept alive only by
hopes and fears, if the qualities upon which it is founded afford no
basis for its subsiding into tender confidence, and rational esteem.
Beauty may inspire a transient desire, vivacity amuse, for a time, by
its sportive graces; but the first will quickly fade and grow familiar&mdash;the
last degenerate into impertinence and insipidity. Interrogate
your own heart&mdash;Would you not, when the ardour of the passions,
and the fervor of the imagination, subsided, wish to find the
sensible, intelligent, friend, take place of the engaging mistress?&mdash;Would
you not expect the economical manager of your affairs, the
rational and judicious mother to your offspring, the faithful sharer
of your cares, the firm friend to your interest, the tender consoler
of your sorrows, the companion in whom you could wholly confide,
the discerning participator of your nobler pursuits, the friend of
your virtues, your talents, your reputation&mdash;who could understand
you, who was formed to pass the ordeal of honour, virtue,
friendship?&mdash;Ask yourself these questions&mdash;ask them closely,
without sophistry, and without evasion. You are not, now, an
infatuated boy! Supposing, then, that you are, at present, entangled
in an engagement which answers not this description&mdash;Is it virtue
to fulfil, or to renounce, it? Contrast it with my affection, with its
probable consequences, and weigh our different claims! <i>Would you
have been the selected choice, of this woman, from all mankind</i>&mdash;would
no other be capable of making her equally happy&mdash;would nothing
compensate to her for your loss&mdash;are you the only object that she
beholds in creation&mdash;might not another engagement suit her
equally well, or better&mdash;is her whole soul absorbed but by one
sentiment, that of fervent love for you&mdash;is her future usefulness, as
well as peace, at stake&mdash;does she understand your high qualities
better than myself&mdash;will she emulate them more?&mdash;Does the
engagement promise a favourable issue, or does it threaten to wear
away the best period of life in protracted and uncertain
feeling&mdash;<i>the most pernicious, and destructive, of all state of mind?</i> Remember,
also, that the summer of life will quickly fade; and that he who
has reached the summit of the hill, has no time to lose&mdash;if he seize
not the present moment, age is approaching, and life melting fast
away.&mdash;I quit this, to state my second hypothesis&mdash;</p>

<p>'That you esteem and respect me, but that your heart has
hitherto refused the sympathies I have sought to awaken in it. If
this be the case, it remains to search for the reason; and, I own, I
am at a loss to find it, either in moral, or physical, causes. Our
principles are in unison, our tastes and habits not dissimilar, our
knowledge of, and confidence in, each other's virtues is reciprocal,
tried, and established&mdash;our ages, personal accomplishments, and
mental acquirements do not materially differ. From such an union,
I conceive, mutual advantages would result. I have found myself
distinguished, esteemed, beloved by, others, where I have not
sought for this distinction. How, then, can I believe it compatible
with the nature of mind, that so many strong efforts, and reiterated
impressions, can have produced no effect upon yours? Is your heart
constituted differently from every other human heart?&mdash;I have
lately observed an inequality in your behaviour, that has whispered
something flattering to my heart. Examine yourself&mdash;Have you felt
no peculiar interest in what concerns me&mdash;would the idea of our
separation affect you with no more than a slight and common
emotion?&mdash;One more question propose to yourself, as a test&mdash;Could
you see me form a new, and more fortunate, attachment,
with indifference? If you cannot, without hesitation, answer these
questions, I have still a powerful pleader in your bosom, though
unconscious of it yourself, that will, ultimately, prevail. If I have,
yet, failed of producing an unequivocal effect, it must arise from
having mistaken the <i>means</i> proper to produce the desired <i>end</i>. My
own sensibility, and my imperfect knowledge of your character
may, here, have combined to mislead me. The first, by its
suffocating and depressing powers, clouding my vivacity, incapacitating
me from appearing to you with my natural advantages&mdash;these
effects would diminish as assurance took the place of doubt.
The last, every day would contribute to correct. Permit me, then, <i>to
hope for</i>, as well as to seek your affections, and if I do not, at length,
gain and secure them, it will be a phenomenon in the history of
mind!</p>

<p>'But to proceed to my third supposition&mdash;The peculiar,
pecuniary, embarrassments of your situation&mdash;Good God! did this
barbarous, insidious, relation, allow himself to consider the
pernicious consequences of his absurd bequest?&mdash;threatening to
undermine every manly principle, to blast every social virtue? Oh!
that I had the eloquence to rouse you from this tame and unworthy
acquiescence&mdash;to stimulate you to exercise your talents, to trust to
the independent energies of your mind, to exert yourself to procure
the honest rewards of virtuous industry. In proportion as we lean
for support on foreign aid, we lose the dignity of our nature, and
palsey those powers which constitute that nature's worth. Yet, I will
allow, from my knowledge of your habits and associations, this
obstacle its full force. But there remains one method of obviating,
even this! I will frankly confess, that could I hope to gain the
interest in your heart, which I have so long and so earnestly sought&mdash;my
confidence in your honour and integrity, my tenderness for
you, added to the wish of contributing to your happiness, would
effect, what no lesser considerations could have effected&mdash;would
triumph, not over my principles, (<i>for the individuality of an affection
constitutes its chastity</i>) but over my prudence. I repeat, I am willing
to sacrifice every inferior consideration&mdash;retain your legacy, so
capriciously bequeathed&mdash;retain your present situation, and I will
retain mine. This proposition, though not a violation of modesty,
certainly involves in it very serious hazards&mdash;<i>It is, wholly, the
triumph of affection!</i> You cannot suppose, that a transient
engagement would satisfy a mind like mine; I should require a
reciprocal faith plighted and returned&mdash;an after separation,
otherwise than by mutual consent, would be my destruction&mdash;I
should not survive your desertion. My existence, then, would be in
your hands. Yet, having once confided, your affection should be
my recompence&mdash;my sacrifice should be a cheerful and a voluntary
one; I would determine not to harrass you with doubts nor
jealousies, I would neither reflect upon the past, nor distrust the
future: I would rest upon you, I would confide in you fearlessly and
entirely! but, though I would not enquire after the past, my delicacy
would require the assurance of your present, undivided, affection.</p>

<p>'The fourth idea that has occurred to me, is the probability of
your having formed a plan of seeking some agreeable woman of
fortune, who should be willing to reward a man of merit for the
injustice of society. Whether you may already have experienced
some disappointments of this nature, I will not pretend to
determine. I can conceive, that, by many women, a coxcomb might
be preferred to you&mdash;however this may be, the plan is not
unattended with risque, nor with some possible degrading
circumstances&mdash;and you may succeed, and yet be miserable:
happiness depends not upon the abundance of our possessions.</p>

<p>'The last case which I shall state, and on which I shall lay little
comparative stress, is the possibility of an engagement of a very
inferior nature&mdash;a mere affair of the senses. The arguments which
might here be adduced are too obvious to be repeated. Besides, I
think highly of your refinement and delicacy&mdash;Having therefore
just hinted, I leave it with you.</p>

<p>'And now to conclude&mdash;After considering all I have urged, you
may, perhaps, reply&mdash;That the subject is too nice and too subtle
for reasoning, and that the heart is not to be compelled. These, I
think, are mistakes. There is no subject, in fact, that may not be
subjected to the laws of investigation and reasoning. What is it that
we desire&mdash;<i>pleasure</i>&mdash;<i>happiness</i>? I allow, pleasure is the supreme
good: but it may be analyzed&mdash;it must have a stable foundation&mdash;to
this analysis I now call you! This is the critical moment, upon
which hangs a long chain of events&mdash;This moment may decide
your future destiny and mine&mdash;it may, even, affect that of unborn
myriads! My spirit is pervaded with these important ideas&mdash;my
heart flutters&mdash;I breathe with difficulty&mdash;<i>My friend</i>&mdash;<i>I would give
myself to you</i>&mdash;the gift is not worthless. Pause a moment, ere you
rudely throw from you an affection so tried, so respectable, so
worthy of you! The heart may be compelled&mdash;compelled by the
touching sympathies which bind, with sacred, indissoluble ties,
mind to mind! Do not prepare for yourself future remorse&mdash;when
lost, you may recollect my worth, and my affection, and remember
them with regret&mdash;Yet mistake me not, I have no intention to
intimidate&mdash;I think it my duty to live, while I may possibly be
useful to others, however bitter and oppressive may be that
existence. I will live <i>for duty</i>, though peace and <ins title="enjoymment">enjoyment</ins> should
be for ever fled. You may rob me of my happiness, you may rob me
of my strength, but, even, you cannot destroy my principles. And, if
no other motive with-held me from rash determinations, my
tenderness for you (it is not a selfish tenderness), would prevent
me from adding, to the anxieties I have already given you, the cruel
pang, of feeling yourself the occasion, however unintentionally, of
the destruction of a fellow creature.</p>

<p>'While I await your answer, I summon to my heart all its
remaining strength and spirits. Say to me, in clear and decisive
terms, that the obstacles which oppose my affection <i>are absolutely,
and altogether, insuperable</i>&mdash;Or that there is a possibility of their
removal, but that time and patience are, yet, necessary to
determine their force. In this case, I will not disturb the future
operations of your mind, assuring myself, that you will continue my
suspence no longer than is proper and requisite&mdash;or frankly
accept, and return, the faith of her to whom you are infinitely
dearer than life itself!</p>

<p>'Early to-morrow morning, a messenger shall call for the paper,
which is to decide the colour of my future destiny. Every moment,
that the blow has been suspended, it has acquired additional force&mdash;since
it must, at length, descend, it would be weakness still to
desire its protraction&mdash;We have, already, refined too much&mdash;<i>I
promise to live&mdash;more, alas! I cannot promise</i>.</p>

<p>'<i>Farewel!</i> dearest and most beloved of men&mdash;whatever may be
my fate&mdash;<i>be happiness yours!</i> Once more, my lingering, foreboding
heart, repeats <i>farewel!</i></p>

<p>It would be unnecessary to paint my feelings during the interval in
which I waited a reply to this letter&mdash;I struggled to repress hope, and
to prepare my mind for the dissolution of a thousand air-built fabrics.
The day wore tediously away in strong emotion, and strong exertion.
On the subsequent morning, I sat, waiting the return of my
messenger, in a state of mind, difficult even to be conceived&mdash;I heard
him enter&mdash;breathless, I flew to meet him&mdash;I held out my hand&mdash;I
could not speak.</p>

<p>'Mr Harley desired me to tell you, <i>he had not had time to write</i>.'</p>

<p>Gracious God! I shudder, even now, to recall the convulsive
sensation! I sunk into a chair&mdash;I sat for some time motionless, every
faculty seemed suspended. At length, returning to recollection, I
wrote a short incoherent note, entreating&mdash;</p>

<p>'To be spared another day, another night, like the preceding&mdash;I
asked only <i>one single line</i>! In the morning I had made up my mind to
fortitude&mdash;it was now sinking&mdash;another day, I could not answer for
the consequences.'</p>

<p>Again an interval of suspense&mdash;again my messenger returned with
a verbal reply&mdash;'<i>He would write to-morrow.</i>' Unconsciously, I
exclaimed&mdash;'<i>Barbarous, unfeeling, unpitying, man!</i>' A burst of tears
relieved&mdash;no&mdash;<i>it did not relieve me</i>. The day passed&mdash;I know not how&mdash;I
dare not recollect.</p>

<p>The next morning, I arose, somewhat refreshed; my exhausted
strength and spirits had procured me a few hours of profound
slumber. A degree of resentment gave a temporary firmness to my
nerves. 'What happiness (I repeated to myself) could I have expected
with a man, thus regardless of my feelings?' I composed my spirits&mdash;<i>hope
was at an end</i>&mdash;into a sort of sullen resignation to my fate&mdash;a
half stupor!</p>

<p>At noon the letter arrived, coldly, confusedly written; methought
there appeared even a degree of irritation in it.</p>

<p>'<i>Another, a prior attachment</i>&mdash;His behaviour had been such, as
necessarily resulted from such an engagement&mdash;unavoidable circumstances
had prevented an earlier reply.' My swollen heart&mdash;but it is
enough&mdash;'He blamed my impatience&mdash;he would, in future, perhaps,
when my mind had attained more composure, make some remarks
on my letter.'</p>

<p>To write had always afforded a temporary relief to my spirits&mdash;The
next day I resumed my pen.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'If, after reflecting upon, and comparing, many parts of your past
conduct, you can acquit yourself, at the sacred bar of humanity&mdash;it
is well! How often have I called for&mdash;urged, with all the energy of
truth and feeling&mdash;but in vain&mdash;such a letter as you have at length
written&mdash;and, <i>even now</i>, though somewhat late, I thank you for it.
Yet, what could have been easier, than to repeat so plain and so
simple a tale? The vague hints, you had before given, I had
repeatedly declared to be insufficient. Remember, all my earnestness,
and all my simplicity, and <i>learn the value of sincerity</i>! "Oh! with
what difficulty is an active mind, once forced into any particular
train, persuaded to desert it as hopeless!"<a name="fn_12r" id="fn_12r"></a><a href="#fn_12"><sup><span class="small">12</span></sup></a></p>

<p>'This recital, then, was not to be confirmed, till the whole moral
conformation of my mind was affected&mdash;till the barbed arrow had
fixed, and rankled in, and poisoned, with its envenomed point,
every vein, every fibre, of my heart. This, I confess, is now the case&mdash;Reason
and self-respect sustain me&mdash;but the wound you have
inflicted <i>is indelible</i>&mdash;it will continue to be the corroding canker at
the root of my peace. My youth has been worn in anguish&mdash;and
the summer of life will probably be overshadowed by a still thicker
and darker cloud. But I mean not to reproach you&mdash;it is not given
me to contribute to your happiness&mdash;the dearest and most ardent
wish of my soul&mdash;I would not then inflict unnecessary pain&mdash;yet, I
would fix upon your mind, the value of <i>unequivocal sincerity</i>.</p>

<p>'Had the happiness of any human being, the meanest, the vilest,
depended as much upon me, as mine has done on you, I would
have sacrificed, for their relief, the dearest secret of my heart&mdash;the
secret, even upon which my very existence had depended. It is
true, you did not directly deceive me&mdash;but is that enough for the
delicacy of humanity? May the past be an affecting lesson to us both&mdash;it
is written upon my mind in characters of blood. I feel, and
acknowledge, my own errors, in yielding to the illusion of vague,
visionary, expectation; but my faults have originated in a generous
source&mdash;they have been the wild, ardent, fervent, excesses, of a
vigorous and an exalted mind!</p>

<p>'I checked my tears, as they flowed, and they are already dried&mdash;uncalled,
unwished, for&mdash;why do they, thus, struggle to force their
way? my mind has, I hope, too much energy, utterly to sink&mdash;I
know what it is to suffer, and to combat with, if not to subdue, my
feelings&mdash;and <i>certainty</i>, itself, is some relief. I am, also, supported
by the retrospect of my conduct; with all its mistakes, and all its
extravagances, it has been that of a virtuous, ingenuous, uncorrupted,
mind. You have contemned a heart of no common value,
you have sported with its exquisite sensibilities&mdash;but it will, still,
know how to separate your virtues from your errors.</p>

<p>'You reprove, perhaps justly, my impatience&mdash;I can only say,
that circumstanced as you were, I should have stolen an hour from
rest, from company, from business, however, important, to have
relieved and soothed a fellow-creature in a situation, so full of pain
and peril. Every thought, during a day scarcely to be recollected
without agony, <i>was a two-edged sword</i>&mdash;but some hours of profound
and refreshing slumber recruited my exhausted spirits, and
enabled me, yesterday, to receive my fate, with a fortitude but little
hoped for.</p>

<p>'You would oblige me exceedingly by the remarks you allow me
to hope for, on my letter of the &mdash;&mdash;th. You know, I will not shrink
from reproof&mdash;that letter afforded you the last proof of my
affection, and I repent not of it. I loved you, first, for what, I
conceived, high qualities of mind&mdash;from nature and association,
my tenderness became personal&mdash;till at length, I loved you, not
only rationally and tenderly&mdash;<i>but passionately</i>&mdash;it became a
pervading and a devouring fire! And, yet, I do not blush&mdash;my
affection was modest, if intemperate, <i>for it was individual</i>&mdash;it
annihilated in my eyes every other man in the creation. I regret
these natural sensations and affections, their forcible suppression
injures the mind&mdash;it converts the mild current of gentle, and genial
sympathies, into a destructive torrent. This, I have the courage to
avow it, has been one of the miserable mistakes in morals, and, like
all other partial remedies, has increased the evil, it was intended to
correct. From monastic institutions and principles have flowed, as
from a polluted source, streams, that have at once spread through
society a mingled contagion of dissoluteness and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>'You have suddenly arrested my affections in their full career&mdash;in
all their glowing effervescence&mdash;you have taken</p>

<tr><td align="left">And placed a blister there."</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>'And, yet, I survive the shock, and determine to live, not for future
enjoyment&mdash;that is now, for ever, past&mdash;<i>but for future usefulness</i>&mdash;Is
not this virtue?</p>

<p>'I am sorry your attachment has been and I fear is likely to be,
protracted&mdash;I know, too well, the misery of these situations, and I
should, now, feel a melancholy satisfaction in hearing of its
completion&mdash;In that completion, may you experience no
disappointment! I do not wish you to be beloved, as I have loved
you; this, perhaps, is unnecessary; such an affection, infallibly,
enslaves the heart that cherishes it; and slavery is the tomb of
virtue and of peace.</p>

<p>'I believe it would not be proper for us to meet again&mdash;at least at
present&mdash;should I hear of sickness, or calamity, befalling you, I
shall, I suspect, be impelled, by an irresistible impulse to seek you&mdash;but
I will no more interrupt your repose&mdash;Though you have
contemned my affection, my friendship will still follow you.</p>

<p>'If you really <i>love</i>, I think you ought to make some sacrifices, and
not render yourself, and the happy object of your tenderness, the
victims of factitious notions.&mdash;Remember&mdash;youth and life will
quickly fade. Relinquish, call upon her to relinquish, her
prejudices&mdash;should she refuse, she is unworthy of you, and you
will regret, too late, the tender, faithful, ingenuous heart, that you
have pierced through and through&mdash;<i>that you have almost broken</i>!
Should she make you happy, I will esteem, though I may never
have an opportunity of thanking, her&mdash;Were she informed of my
conduct, she might rejoice in the trial of your affection&mdash;though I
should not.</p>

<p>'The spirits, that had crouded round my heart, are already
subsiding&mdash;a flood of softness, a tide of overwhelming affection,
gushes upon it&mdash;and I feel sinking into helpless, infantine, distress!
Hasten to me your promised remarks&mdash;they will rouse, they will
strengthen, me&mdash;<i>Truth</i> I will never call indelicate or inhuman&mdash;it
is only the virtuous mind can dare to practise, to challenge, it:&mdash;simplicity
is true refinement.</p>

<p>'Let us reap from the past all the good we can&mdash;a close, and
searching, knowledge of the secret springs and foldings of our
hearts. Methinks, I could wish you justified, <i>even at my own expence</i>.&mdash;I
ask, unshrinkingly, a frank return.</p>

<p>'A heart-rending sigh accompanies my <i>farewel</i>&mdash;the last
struggles of expiring nature will be far less painful&mdash;but my
philosophy, now, <i>sternly</i> calls upon me to put its precepts in
practice&mdash;trembling&mdash;shuddering&mdash;I obey!</p>

<p>Perhaps it cost me some effort to make the preceding letter so

<p>A letter from the country made it necessary for me, again, to
address Mr Harley, to make some enquiries which respected
business of his mother's. It may be, that I felt a mixture of other
motives;&mdash;it is certain, that when I wrote, I spoke of more than
business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'I had hoped,' I told him, 'ere this, to have received the
promised letter&mdash;Yet, I do not take up my pen,' said I, 'either to
complain of, or to importune, you. If I have already expressed
myself with bitterness, let the harrassed state of my mind be my
excuse. My own conduct has been too erroneous, too eccentric, to
enable me to judge impartially of your's. Forgive me, if by placing
you in an embarrassing situation, I have exposed you to consequent
mistake or uneasiness. I feel, that whatever errors we may either of
us have committed, <i>originated only with myself</i>, and I am content to
suffer all the consequences. It is true, had you reposed in me an

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">"There, where the human heart most exquisitely feels!"
</p>
</div>

<p>'You had been still my friend, and I had been comparatively happy.
Every passion is, in a great measure, the growth of indulgence: all
our desires are, in their commencement, easily suppressed, when
there appears no probability of attaining their object; but when
strengthened, by time and reflection, into habit, in endeavouring to
eradicate them, we tear away part of the mind. In my attachments
there is a kind of savage tenacity&mdash;they are of an elastic nature,
and, being forced back, return with additional violence.</p>

<p>'My affection for you has not been, altogether, irrational or
selfish. While I felt that I loved you, as no other woman, I was
convinced, would love you&mdash;I conceived, could I once engage your
heart, I could satisfy, and even, purify it. While I loved your
virtues, I thought I saw, and I lamented, the foibles which sullied
them. I suspected you, perhaps erroneously, of pride, ambition, the
love of distinction; yet your ambition could not, I thought, be of an
ignoble nature&mdash;I feared that the gratifications you sought, if,
indeed, attainable, were factitious&mdash;I even fancied I perceived you,
against your better judgment, labouring to seduce yourself!' "He is
under a delusion," said I, to myself;&mdash;"reason may be stunned, or
blinded, for awhile; but it will revive in the heart, and do its office,
when sophistry will be of no avail." I saw you struggling with
vexations, that I was assured might be meliorated by tender
confidence&mdash;I longed to pour its balms into your bosom. My
sensibility disquieted you, and myself, only <i>because it was constrained</i>.
I thought I perceived a conflict in your mind&mdash;I watched
its progress with attention and solicitude. A thousand times has my
fluttering heart yearned to break the cruel chains that fettered it,
and to chase the cloud, which stole over your brow, by the tender,
yet chaste, caresses and endearments of ineffable affection! My
feelings became too highly wrought, and altogether insupportable.
Sympathy for your situation, zeal for your virtues, love for your
mind, tenderness for your person&mdash;a complication of generous,
affecting, exquisite, emotions, impelled me to make one great
effort.&mdash;"<a name="fn_13r" id="fn_13r"></a><a href="#fn_13"><sup><span class="small">13</span></sup></a> The world might call my plans absurd, my views
romantic, my pretensions extravagant&mdash;Was I, or was I not, guilty
of any crime, when, in the very acme of the passions, I so totally
disregarded the customs of the world?" Ah! what were my
sensations&mdash;what did I not suffer, in the interval?&mdash;and you
prolonged that cruel interval&mdash;and still you suffer me to doubt,
whether, at the moment in my life when I was actuated by the
highest, the most fervent, the most magnanimous, principles&mdash;whether,
at that moment, when I most deserved your respect, I did
not for ever forfeit it.</p>

<p>'I seek not to extenuate any part of my conduct&mdash;I confess that it
has been wild, extravagant, romantic&mdash;I confess, that, even for
your errors, I am justly blameable&mdash;and yet I am unable to bear,
because I feel they would be unjust, your hatred and contempt. I
cherish no resentment&mdash;my spirit is subdued and broken&mdash;your
unkindness sinks into my soul.</p>

<p>Another fortnight wore away in fruitless expectation&mdash;the morning
rose, the evening closed, upon me, in sadness. I could not, yet, think
the mystery developed: on a concentrated view of the circumstances,
they appeared to me contradictory, and irreconcileable. A solitary
enthusiast, a child in the drama of the world, I had yet to learn, that
those who have courage to act upon advanced principles, must be
content to suffer moral martyrdom.<a name="fn_14r" id="fn_14r"></a><a href="#fn_14"><sup><span class="small">14</span></sup></a> In subduing our own prejudices,
we have done little, while assailed on every side by the prejudices of
others. My own heart acquitted me; but I dreaded that distortion of
mind, that should wrest guilt out of the most sublime of its
emanations.</p>

<p>I ruminated in gloomy silence, on my forlorn, and hopeless,
situation. 'If there be not a future state of being,' said I to myself,
'what is this!&mdash;Tortured in every stage of it, "Man cometh forth like
a flower, and is cut down&mdash;he fleeth, as a shadow, and continueth
not!"&mdash;I looked backward on my past life, and my heart sickened&mdash;its
confidence in humanity was shaken&mdash;I looked forward, and all was
cheerless. I had certainly committed many errors!&mdash;Who has not&mdash;who,
with a fancy as lively, feelings as acute, and a character as
sanguine, as mine? "What, in fact," says a philosophic writer,<a name="fn_15r" id="fn_15r"></a><a href="#fn_15"><sup><span class="small">15</span></sup></a> "is
character?&mdash;the production of a lively and constant affection, and
consequently, of a strong passion:"&mdash;eradicate that passion, that
ferment, that leaven, that exuberance, which raises and makes the
mind what it is, and what remains? Yet, let us beware how we
wantonly expend this divine, this invigorating, power. Every grand
error, in a mind of energy, in its operations and consequences,
carries us years forward&mdash;<i>precious years, never to be recalled</i>!' I could
find no substitute for the sentiments I regretted&mdash;for that sentiment
formed my character; and, but for the obstacles which gave it force,
though I might have suffered less misery, I should, I suspect, have
gained less improvement; still adversity <i>is a real evil</i>; and I foreboded
that this improvement had been purchased too dear.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_Xa" id="ch_Xa"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p>Weeks elapsed ere the promised letter arrived&mdash;a letter still colder,
and more severe, than the former. I wept over it, bitter tears! It
accused me 'of adding to the vexations of a situation, before
sufficiency oppressive.'&mdash;Alas! had I known the nature of those
vexations, could I have merited such a reproof? The Augustus, I had
so long and so tenderly loved, no longer seemed to exist. Some one
had, surely, usurped his signature, and imitated those characters, I
had been accustomed to trace with delight. He tore himself from me,
<i>nor would he deign to soften the pang of separation</i>. Anguish
overwhelmed me&mdash;my heart was pierced. Reclining my head on my
folded arms, I yielded myself up to silent grief. Alone, sad, desolate,
no one heeded my sorrows&mdash;no eye pitied me&mdash;no friendly voice
cheered my wounded spirit! The social propensities of a mind
forbidden to expand itself, forced back, preyed incessantly upon that
mind, secretly consuming its powers.</p>

<p>I was one day roused from these melancholy reflections by the
entrance of my cousin, Mrs Denbeigh. She held in her hand a letter,
from my only remaining friend, Mrs Harley. I snatched it hastily; my
heart, lacerated by the seeming unkindness of him in whom it had
confided, yearned to imbibe the consolation, which the gentle
tenderness of this dear, maternal, friend, had never failed to
administer. The first paragraph informed me&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'That she had, a few days since, received a letter from the
person to whom the legacy of her son devolved, should he fail in
observing the prescribed conditions of the testator: that this letter
gave her notice, that those conditions had already been infringed,
Mr Harley having contracted a marriage, three years before, with a
foreigner, with whom he had become acquainted during his
travels; that this marriage had been kept a secret, and, but very
lately, by an accidental concurrence of circumstances, revealed to
the person most concerned in the detection. Undoubted proofs of
the truth of this information could be produced; it would therefore
be most prudent in her son to resign his claims, without putting
himself, and the legal heir, to unnecessary expence and litigation.
Ignorant of the residence of Mr Harley, the writer troubled his
mother to convey to him these particulars.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper dropped from my hand, the colour forsook my lips and
cheeks;&mdash;yet I neither wept, nor fainted. Mrs Denbeigh took my
hands&mdash;they were frozen&mdash;the blood seemed congealed in my veins&mdash;and
I sat motionless&mdash;my faculties suspended, stunned, locked up!
My friend spake to me&mdash;embraced, shed tears over, me&mdash;but she
could not excite mine;&mdash;my mind was pervaded by a sense of
confused misery. I remained many days in this situation&mdash;it was a
state, of which I have but a feeble remembrance; and I, at length,
awoke from it, as from a troublesome dream.</p>

<p>With returning reason, the tide of recollection also returned. Oh!
how complicated appeared to me the guilt of Augustus! Ignorant of
his situation, I had been unconsciously, and perseveringly, exerting
myself to seduce the affections of a <i>husband</i> from his <i>wife</i>. He had
made me almost criminal in my own eyes&mdash;he had risqued, at once,
by a disingenuous and cruel reserve, the virtue and the happiness of
three beings. What is virtue, but a calculation of <i>the consequences of our
actions</i>? Did we allow ourselves to reason on this principle, to reflect
on its truth and importance, we should be compelled to shudder at
many parts of our conduct, which, <i>taken unconnectedly</i>, we have
habituated ourselves to consider as almost indifferent. Virtue can
exist only in a mind capable of taking comprehensive views. How
criminal, then, is ignorance!</p>

<p>During this sickness of the soul, Mr Francis, who had occasionally
visited me since my residence in town, called, repeatedly, to enquire
after my welfare; expressing a friendly concern for my indisposition. I
saw him not&mdash;I was incapable of seeing any one&mdash;but, informed by
my kind hostess of his humane attentions, soothed by the idea of
having yet a friend who seemed to interest himself in my concerns, I
once more had recourse to my pen (Mrs Denbeigh having officiously
placed the implements of writing in my way), and addressed him in
the wild and incoherent language of despair.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO MR FRANCIS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'You once told me, that I was incapable of heroism; and you
were right&mdash;yet, I am called to great exertions! a blow that has
been suspended over my head, days, weeks, months, years, has at
length fallen&mdash;still I live! My tears flow&mdash;I struggle, in vain, to
suppress them, but they are not tears of blood!&mdash;My heart, though
pierced through and through, is not broken!</p>

<p>'My friend, come and teach me how to acquire fortitude&mdash;I am
wearied with misery&mdash;All nature is to me a blank&mdash;an envenomed
shaft rankles in my bosom&mdash;philosophy will not heal the festering
wound&mdash;<i>I am exquisitely wretched!</i></p>

<p>'Do not chide me till I get more strength&mdash;I speak to you of my
sorrows, for your kindness, while I was yet a stranger to you,
inspired me with confidence, and my desolate heart looks round
for support.</p>

<p>'I am indebted to you&mdash;how shall I repay your goodness? Do
you, indeed, interest yourself in my fate? Call upon me, then, for
the few incidents of my life&mdash;I will relate them simply, and without
disguise. There is nothing uncommon in them, but the effect which
they have produced upon my mind&mdash;yet, that mind they formed.</p>

<p>'After all, my friend, what a wretched farce is life! Why cannot I
sleep, and, close my eyes upon it for ever? But something whispers,
"<i>this would be wrong</i>."&mdash;How shall I tear from my heart all its
darling, close twisted, associations?&mdash;And must I live&mdash;<i>live for
what?</i> God only knows! Yet, how am I sure that there is a God&mdash;is
he wise&mdash;is he powerful&mdash;is he benevolent? If he be, can he sport
himself in the miseries of poor, feeble, impotent, beings, forced
into existence, without their choice&mdash;impelled, by the iron hand of
necessity, through mistake, into calamity?&mdash;Ah! my friend, who
will condemn the poor solitary wanderer, whose feet are pierced
with many a thorn, should he turn suddenly out of the rugged path,
seek an obscure shade to shrowd his wounds, his sorrows, and his
indignation, from the scorn of a pitiless world, and accelerate the
hour of repose.<a name="fn_16r" id="fn_16r"></a><a href="#fn_16"><span class="small">16</span></a> Who would be born if they could help it? You
would perhaps&mdash;<i>you may do good</i>&mdash;But on me, the sun shines only
to mock my woes&mdash;Oh! that I had never seen the light.</p>

<p>'Torn by conflicting passions&mdash;wasted in anguish&mdash;life is
melting fast away&mdash;A burthen to myself, a grief to those who love
me, and worthless to every one. Weakened by long suspence&mdash;preyed
upon, by a combination of imperious feelings&mdash;I fear, I
greatly fear, the <i>irrecoverable blow is struck</i>! But I blame no one&mdash;I
have been entangled in error&mdash;<i>who is faultless?</i></p>

<p>'While pouring itself out on paper, my tortured mind has
experienced a momentary relief: If your heart be inaccessible to
tender sympathies, I have only been adding one more to my
numberless mistakes!</p>

<p>Mr Francis visited me, and evinced for my situation the most
humane and delicate consideration. He reminded me of the offer I
had made him, and requested the performance of my engagement. In
compliance with this request, and to beguile my melancholy thoughts,
I drew up a sketch of the events of my past life, and unfolded a
history of the sentiments of my mind (from which I have extracted
the preceding materials) reserving only any circumstance which might
lead to a detection of the name and family of the man with whom
they were so intimately blended.</p>

<p class="small"><a name="fn_16" id="fn_16"></a><a href="#fn_16r">16:</a> This is the reasoning of a mind distorted by passion. Even in the moment of

<h3><a name="ch_XIa" id="ch_XIa"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>After having perused my manuscript, Mr Francis returned it, at my
desire, accompanied by the following letter.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO EMMA COURTNEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'Your narrative leaves me full of admiration for your qualities,
and compassion for your insanity.</p>

<p>'I entreat however your attention to the following passage,
extracted from your papers. "After considering all I have urged,
you may perhaps reply, that the subject is too nice, and too subtle,
for reasoning, and that the heart is not to be compelled. This, I
think, is a mistake. There is no topic, in fact, that may not be
subjected to the laws of investigation and reasoning. What is it we
desire? pleasure, happiness. What! the pleasure of an instant, only;
or that which is more solid and permanent? I allow, pleasure is the
supreme good! but it may be analysed. To this analysis I now call
you."</p>

<p>'Could I, if I had studied for years, invent a comment on your
story, more salutary to your sorrows, more immoveable in its
foundation, more clearly expressed, or more irresistibly convincing
to every rational mind?</p>

<p>'How few real, substantial, misfortunes there are in the world!
how few calamities, the sting of which does not depend upon our
cherishing the viper in our bosom, and applying the aspic to our
veins! The general pursuit of all men, we are frequently told, is
happiness. I have often been tempted to think, on the contrary, that
the general pursuit is misery. It is true, men do not recognize it by
its genuine appellation; they content themselves with the pitiful
expedient of assigning it a new denomination. But, if their
professed purpose were misery, could they be more skilful and
ingenious in the pursuit?</p>

<p>'Look through your whole life. To speak from your own
description, was there ever a life, in its present period, less
chequered with substantial <i>bona fide</i> misfortune? The whole force
of every thing which looks like a misfortune was assiduously,
unintermittedly, provided by yourself. You nursed in yourself a
passion, which, taken in the degree in which you experienced it, is
the unnatural and odious invention of a distempered civilization,
and which in almost all instances generates an immense overbalance
of excruciating misery. Your conduct will scarcely admit of
any other denomination than moon-struck madness, hunting after
torture. You addressed a man impenetrable as a rock, and the
smallest glimpse of sober reflection, and common sense, would
have taught you instantly to have given up the pursuit.</p>

<p>'I know you will tell me, and you will tell yourself, a great deal
about constitution, early association, and the indissoluble chain of
habits and sentiments. But I answer with small fear of being
erroneous, "It is a mistake to suppose, that the heart is not to be
compelled. There is no topic, in fact, that may not be subjected to
the laws of investigation and reasoning. Pleasure, happiness, is the
supreme good; and happiness is susceptible of being analysed." I
grant, that the state of a human mind cannot be changed at once;
but, had you worshipped at the altar of reason but half as
assiduously as you have sacrificed at the shrine of illusion, your
present happiness would have been as enviable, as your present
distress is worthy of compassion. If men would but take the trouble
to ask themselves, once every day, Why should I be miserable? how
many, to whom life is a burthen, would become chearful and
contented.</p>

<p>'Make a catalogue of all the real evils of human life; bodily pain,
compulsory solitude, severe corporal labour, in a word, all those
causes which deprive us of health, or the means of spending our
time in animated, various, and rational pursuits. Aye, these are real
evils! But I should be ashamed of putting disappointed love into
my enumeration. Evils of this sort are the brood of folly begotten
upon fastidious indolence. They shrink into non-entity, when
touched by the wand of truth.</p>

<p>'The first lesson of enlightened reason, the great fountain of
heroism and virtue, the principle by which alone man can become
what man is capable of being, is <i>independence</i>. May every power that
is favourable to integrity, to honour, defend me from leaning upon
another for support! I will use the word, I will use my fellow men,
but I will not abuse these invaluable benefits of the system of
nature. I will not be weak and criminal enough, to make my peace
depend upon the precarious thread of another's life or another's
pleasure. I will judge for myself; I will draw my support from
myself&mdash;the support of my existence and the support of my
happiness. The system of nature has perhaps made me dependent
for the means of existence and happiness upon my fellow men
taken collectively; but nothing but my own folly can make me
dependent upon individuals. Will these principles prevent me from
admiring, esteeming, and loving such as are worthy to excite these
emotions? Can I not have a mind to understand, and a heart to feel
excellence, without first parting with the fairest attribute of my
nature?</p>

<p>'You boast of your sincerity and frankness. You have doubtless
some reason for your boast&mdash;Yet all your misfortunes seem to have
arisen from concealment. You brooded over your emotions, and
considered them as a sacred deposit&mdash;You have written to me, I
have seen you frequently, during the whole of this transaction,
without ever having received the slightest hint of it, yet, if I be a fit
counsellor now, I was a fit counsellor then; your folly was so gross,
that, if it had been exposed to the light of day, it could not have
subsisted for a moment. Even now you suppress the name of your
hero: yet, unless I know how much of a hero and a model of
excellence he would appear in my eyes, I can be but a very
imperfect judge of the affair.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XIIa" id="ch_XIIa"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>To the remonstrance of my friend, which roused me from the
languor into which I was sinking, I immediately replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO MR FRANCIS.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'You retort upon me my own arguments, and you have cause. I
felt a ray of conviction dart upon my mind, even, while I wrote
them. But what then?&mdash;"I seemed to be in a state, in which reason
had no power; I felt as if I could coolly survey the several
arguments of the case&mdash;perceive, that they had prudence, truth,
and common sense on their side&mdash;And then answer&mdash;I am under
the guidance of a director more energetic than you!"<a name="fn_17r" id="fn_17r"></a><a href="#fn_17"><sup><span class="small">17</span></sup></a> I am
affected by your kindness&mdash;I am affected by your letter. I could
weep over it, bitter tears of conviction and remorse. But argue with
the wretch infected with the plague&mdash;will it stop the tide of blood,
that is rapidly carrying its contagion to the heart? I blush! I shed
burning tears! But I am still desolate and wretched! And how am I
to stop it? The force which you impute to my reasoning was the
powerful frenzy of a high delirium.</p>

<p>'What does it signify whether, abstractedly considered, a
misfortune be worthy of the names real and substantial, if the
consequences produced are the same? That which embitters all my
life, that which stops the genial current of health and peace is,
whatever be its nature, a real calamity to me. There is no end to
this reasoning&mdash;what individual can limit the desires of another?
The necessaries of the civilized man are whimsical superfluities in
the eye of the savage. Are we, or are we not (as you have taught
me) the creatures of sensation and circumstance?</p>

<p>'I agree with you&mdash;and the more I look into society, the deeper I
feel the soul-sickening conviction&mdash;"The general pursuit is
misery"&mdash;necessarily&mdash;excruciating misery, from the source to
which you justly ascribe it&mdash;"<i>The unnatural and odious inventions of
a distempered civilization.</i>" I am content, you may perceive, to
recognize things by their genuine appellation. I am, at least, a
reasoning maniac: perhaps the most dangerous species of insanity.
But while the source continues troubled, why expect the streams to
run pure?</p>

<p>'You know I will tell you&mdash;"about the indissoluble chains of
association and habit:" and you attack me again with my own
weapons! Alas! while I confess their impotence, with what
consistency do I accuse the flinty, impenetrable, heart, I so
earnestly sought, in vain, to move? What materials does this
stubborn mechanism of the mind offer to the wise and benevolent
legislator!</p>

<p>'Had I, you tell me, "worshipped at the altar of reason, but half
as assiduously as I have sacrificed at the shrine of illusion, my
happiness might have been enviable." But do you not perceive, that
my reason was the auxiliary of my passion, or rather my passion the
generative principle of my reason? Had not these contradictions,
these oppositions, roused the energy of my mind, I might have
domesticated, tamely, in the lap of indolence and apathy.</p>

<p>'I do ask myself, every day&mdash;"Why should I be miserable?"&mdash;and
I answer, "Because the strong, predominant, sentiment of my
soul, close twisted with all its cherished associations, has been
rudely torn away, and the blood flows from the lacerated wound.
You would be ashamed of placing disappointed love in your
enumeration of evils! Gray was not ashamed of this&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>'Is it possible that you can be insensible of all the mighty mischiefs
which have been caused by this passion&mdash;of the great events and
changes of society, to which it has operated as a powerful, though
secret, spring? That Jupiter shrouded his glories beneath a mortal
form; that he descended yet lower, and crawled as a reptile&mdash;that
Hercules took the distaff, and Sampson was shorn of his strength,
are in their spirit, no fables. Yet, these were the legends of ages
less degenerate than this, and states of society less corrupt. Ask
your own heart&mdash;whether some of its most exquisite sensations
have not arisen from sources, which, to nine-tenths of the world,
would be equally inconceivable: Mine, I believe, is a <i>solitary
madness in the eighteenth century: it is not on the altars of love, but of
gold, that men, now, come to pay their offerings</i>.</p>

<p>'Why call woman, miserable, oppressed, and impotent, woman&mdash;<i>crushed,
and then insulted</i>&mdash;why call her to <i>independence</i>&mdash;which not
nature, but the barbarous and accursed laws of society, have
denied her? <i>This is mockery!</i> Even you, wise and benevolent as you
are, can mock the child of slavery and sorrow! "Excluded, as it
were, by the pride, luxury, and caprice, of the world, from
expanding my sensations, and wedding my soul to society, I was
constrained to bestow the strong affections, that glowed consciously
within me, upon a few."<a name="fn_18r" id="fn_18r"></a><a href="#fn_18"><sup><span class="small">18</span></sup></a> Love, in minds of any elevation, cannot
be generated but upon a real, or fancied, foundation of excellence.
But what would be a miracle in architecture, is true in morals&mdash;the
fabric can exist when the foundation has mouldered away. <i>Habit</i>
daily produces this wonderful effect upon every feeling, and every
principle. Is not this the theory which you have taught me?</p>

<p>'Am I not sufficiently ingenuous?&mdash;I will give you a new proof of
my frankness (though not the proof you require).&mdash;From the
miserable consequences of wretched moral distinctions, from
chastity having been considered as a sexual virtue, all these
calamities have flowed. Men are thus rendered sordid and
dissolute in their pleasures; their affections vitiated, and their
feelings petrified; the simplicity of modest tenderness loses its
charm; they become incapable of satisfying the heart of a woman of
sensibility and virtue.&mdash;Half the sex, then, are the wretched,
degraded, victims of brutal instinct: the remainder, if they sink not
into mere frivolity and insipidity, are sublimed into a sort of&mdash;[what
shall I call them?]&mdash;refined, romantic, factitious, unfortunate,
beings; who, for the sake of the present moment, dare not
expose themselves to complicated, inevitable, evils; evils, that will
infallibly overwhelm them with misery and regret! Woe be, more
especially, to those who, possessing the dangerous gifts of fancy
and feeling, find it as difficult to discover a substitute for the object
as for the sentiment! You, who are a philosopher, will you still
controvert the principles founded in truth and nature? "Gross as is
my folly," (and I do not deny it) "you may perceive I was not
wholly wandering in darkness. But while the wintry sun of hope
illumined the fairy frost-work with a single, slanting ray&mdash;dazzled
by the transient brightness, I dreaded the meridian fervors that
should dissolve the glittering charm." Yes! it was madness&mdash;but it
was the pleasurable madness which none but madmen know.</p>

<p>'I cannot answer your question&mdash;Pain me not by its repetition;
neither seek to ensnare me to the disclosure. Unkindly, severely, as
I have been treated, I will not risque, even, the possibility of
injuring the man, whom I have so tenderly loved, in the esteem of
any one. Were I to name him, you know him not; you could not
judge of his qualities. He is not "a model of excellence." I perceive
it, with pain&mdash;and if obliged to retract my judgment on some parts
of his character&mdash;I retract it with agonizing reluctance! But I could
trace the sources of his errors, and candour and self-abasement
imperiously compel me to a mild judgment, to stifle the petulant
suggestions of a wounded spirit.</p>

<p>'Ought not our principles, my friend, to soften the asperity of
our censures?&mdash;Could I have won him to my arms, I thought I
could soften, and even elevate, his mind&mdash;a mind, in which I still
perceive a great proportion of good. I weep for him, as well as for
myself. He will, one day, know my value, and feel my loss. Still, I
am sensible, that, by my extravagance, I have given a great deal of
vexation (possibly some degradation), to a being, whom I had no
right to persecute, or to compel to chuse happiness through a
medium of my creation. I cannot exactly tell the extent of the injury
I may have done him. A long train of consequences succeed, even,
our most indifferent actions.&mdash;Strong energies, though they
answer not the end proposed, must yet produce correspondent
effects. Morals and mechanics are here analogous. No longer,
then, distress me by the repetition of a question I ought not to
answer. I am content to be the victim&mdash;Oh! may I be the only
victim&mdash;of my folly!</p>

<p>'One more observation allow me to make, before I conclude.
That we can "admire, esteem, and love," an individual&mdash;(for love
in the abstract, loving mankind collectively, conveys to me no idea)&mdash;which
must be, in fact, depending upon that individual for a
large share of our felicity, and not lament his loss, in proportion to
our apprehension of his worth, appears to me a proposition,
involving in itself an absurdity; therefore demonstrably false.</p>

<p>'Let me, my friend, see you ere long&mdash;your remonstrance has
affected me&mdash;save me from myself!'</p></blockquote>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO THE SAME.<br />
[In continuation.]</p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>'My letter having been delayed a few days, through a mistake&mdash;I
resume my pen; for, running my eye over what I had written, I
perceive (confounded by the force of your expressions) I have
granted you too much. My conduct was not, altogether, so insane
as I have been willing to allow. It is certain, that could I have
attained the end proposed, my happiness had been encreased. "It
is necessary for me to love and admire, or I sink into sadness."
The behaviour of the man, whom I sought to move, appeared to
me too inconsistent to be the result of <i>indifference</i>. To be roused
and stimulated by obstacles&mdash;obstacles admitting hope, because
obscurely seen&mdash;is no mark of weakness. Could I have subdued,
what I, <i>then</i>, conceived to be the <i>prejudices</i> of a worthy man, I could
have increased both his happiness and my own. I deeply reasoned,
and philosophized, upon the subject. <ins title="original has Persevervance">Perseverance</ins>, with little
ability, has effected wonders;&mdash;with perseverance, I felt, that, I had
the power of uniting ability&mdash;confiding in that power, I was the
dupe of my own reason. No other man, perhaps, could have acted
the part which this man has acted:&mdash;how, then, was I to take such
a part into my calculations?</p>

<p>'Do not misconceive me&mdash;it is no miracle that I did not inspire
affection. On this subject, the mortification I have suffered has
humbled me, it may be, even, unduly in my own eyes&mdash;but to the
emotions of my pride, I would disdain to give words. Whatever
may have been my feelings, I am too proud to express the rage of
slighted love!&mdash;Yet, I am sensible to all the powers of those
charming lines of Pope&mdash;</p>

<p>'But to return. I pursued, comparatively, (as I thought) a certain
good; and when, at times, discouraged, I have repeated to myself&mdash;What!
after all these pains, shall I relinquish my efforts, when,
perhaps, on the very verge of success?&mdash;To say nothing of the
difficulty of forcing an active mind out of its trains&mdash;if I desisted,
what was to be the result? The sensations I now feel&mdash;apathy,
stagnation, abhorred vacuity!</p>

<p>'You cannot resist the force of my reasoning&mdash;you, who are
acquainted with, who know how to paint, in colours true to nature,
the human heart&mdash;you, who admire, as a proof of power, the
destructive courage of an Alexander, even the fanatic fury of a
Ravaillac&mdash;you, who honour the pernicious ambition of an
Augustus C&aelig;sar, as bespeaking the potent, energetic, mind!&mdash;why
should <i>you</i> affect to be intolerant to a passion, though differing in
nature, generated on the same principles, and by a parallel process.
The capacity of perception, or of receiving sensation, is (or
generates) the power; into what channel that power shall be
directed, depends not on ourselves. Are we not the creatures of
outward impressions? Without such impressions, should we be any
thing? Are not passions and powers synonimous&mdash;or can the latter
be produced without the lively interest that constitutes the former?
Do you dream of annihilating the one&mdash;and will not the other be
extinguished? With the apostle, Paul, permit me to say&mdash;"I am not
mad, but speak the words of truth and soberness."</p>

<p>'To what purpose did you read my confessions, but to trace in
them a character formed, like every other human character, by the
result of unavoidable impressions, and the chain of necessary
events. I feel, that my arguments are incontrovertible:&mdash;I suspect
that, by affecting to deny their force, you will endeavour to deceive
either me or yourself.&mdash;I have acquired the power of reasoning on
this subject at a dear rate&mdash;at the expence of inconceivable
suffering. Attempt not to deny me the miserable, expensive,
victory. I am ready to say&mdash;(ungrateful that I am)&mdash;Why did you
put me upon calling forth my strong reason?</p>

<p>'I perceive there is no cure for me&mdash;(apathy is, not the
restoration to health, but, the morbid lethargy of the soul) but by a
new train of impressions, of whatever nature, equally forcible with
the past.&mdash;You will tell me, It remains with myself whether I will
predetermine to resist such impressions. Is this true? Is it
philosophical? Ask yourself. What!&mdash;can <i>even you</i> shrink from the
consequences of your own principles?</p>

<p>'One word more&mdash;You accuse me of brooding in silence over
my sensations&mdash;of considering them as a "sacred deposit."
Concealment is particularly repugnant to my disposition&mdash;yet a
thousand delicacies&mdash;a thousand nameless solicitudes, and
apprehensions, sealed my lips!&mdash;He who inspired them was, alone,
the depositary of my most secret thoughts!&mdash;my heart was
unreservedly open before him&mdash;I covered my paper with its
emotions, and transmitted it to him&mdash;like him who whispered his
secret into the earth, to relieve the burden of uncommunicated
thought. My secret was equally safe, and received in equal silence!
Alas! he was not then ignorant of the effects it was likely to
produce!</p>

<p>Mr Francis continued his humane and friendly attentions; and,
while he opposed my sentiments, as conceiving them destructive of
my tranquillity, mingled with his opposition a gentle and delicate
consideration for my feelings, that sensibly affected me, and excited
my grateful attachment. He judged right, that, by stimulating my
mind into action, the sensations, which so heavily oppressed it, might
be, in some measure, mitigated&mdash;by diverting the course of my ideas
into different channels, and by that means abating their force. His
kindness soothed and flattered me, and communications relieved my
thoughts.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XIIIa" id="ch_XIIIa"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p>The period which succeeded these events, though tedious in wearing
away, marked by no vicissitude, has left little impression behind. The
tenor of my days resembled the still surface of a stagnant lake,
embosomed in a deep cavern, over which the refreshing breezes
never sweep. Sad, vacant, inactive&mdash;the faculties both of mind and
body seemed almost suspended. I became weak, languid, enervated&mdash;my
disorder was a lethargy of soul. This was gradually succeeded by
disease of body:&mdash;an inactivity, so contrary to all the habits of my past
life, generated morbid humours, and brought on a slow, remitting,
fever. I recovered, by degrees, from this attack, but remained for
some time in a debilitated, though convalescent, state. A few weeks
after my disorder returned, lasted longer, and left me still more
weakened and depressed. A third time it assailed me, at a shorter
interval; and, though less violent, was more protracted, and more
exhausting.</p>

<p>Mrs Denbeigh, alarmed by my situation, wrote to Mrs Harley,
expressing the apprehensions which she entertained. From this dear
friend, who was herself in a declining state of health, I received a
pressing invitation to visit, once more, the village of <span class="nowrap">F&mdash;&mdash;</span>; and to
seek, from change of air, change of scene, and the cordial
endearments of friendship, a restoration for my debilitated frame,
and a balm for my wounded mind.</p>

<p>My relation, at this period, had letters from her husband,
informing her, that the term of his residence in India was prolonged;
pressing her to join him there, and to come over in the next ship. To
this request she joyfully acceded; and, hearing that a packet was
about to sail for Bengal, secured her passage, and began immediately
to make preparations for her departure. I no longer hesitated to
comply with the entreaties of my friend; besides the tie of strong
affection, which drew me to her, I had, at present, little other
resource.</p>

<p>After affectionately embracing Mrs Denbeigh, wishing a happy
issue to her voyage, thanking her for all her kindness, and leaving a
letter of grateful acknowledgement for Mr Francis, I quitted the
metropolis, with an aching heart, and a wasted frame. My cousin
accompanied me to the inn, from whence the vehicle set out that was
to convey me to Mrs Harley. We parted in silence&mdash;a crowd of
retrospective ideas of the past, and solicitudes respecting the future,
occupied our thoughts&mdash;our sensations were too affecting for words.</p>

<p>The carriage quitted London at the close of the evening, and
travelled all night:&mdash;it was towards the end of the year. At midnight
we passed over Hounslow and Bagshot heaths. 'The moon,' to adopt
the language of Ossian, 'looked through broken clouds, and
brightened their dark-brown sides.' A loud November blast howled
over the heath, and whistled through the fern.&mdash;There was a
melancholy desolation in the scene, that was in unison with my
feelings, and which overwhelmed my spirits with a tide of tender
recollections. I recalled to my imagination a thousand interesting
images&mdash;I indulged in all the wild enthusiasm of my character. My
fellow-travellers slept tranquilly, while my soul was awake to
agonizing sorrow. I adopted the language of the tender Eloisa&mdash;'Why,'
said I, 'am I indebted for life to his care, whose cruelty has
rendered it insupportable? Inhuman, as he is, let him fly from me for
ever, and deny himself the savage pleasure of being an eye-witness to
my sorrows!&mdash;But why do I rave thus?&mdash;He is not to be blamed&mdash;<i>I,
alone, am guilty</i>&mdash;I, alone, am the author of my own misfortunes, and
should, therefore, be the only object of anger and resentment.'<a name="fn_19r" id="fn_19r"></a><a href="#fn_19"><sup><span class="small">19</span></sup></a></p>

<p>Weakened by my late indisposition, fatigued by the rough motion
of the carriage, and exhausted by strong emotion, when arrived at the
end of my journey, I was obliged to be lifted from the coach, and
carried into the cottage of my friend. The servant led the way to the
library&mdash;the door opened&mdash;Mrs Harley advanced, to receive me,
with tottering steps. The ravages of grief, and the traces of sickness,
were visible in her dear, affectionate, countenance. I clasped my
hands, and, lifting up my eyes, beheld the portrait of Augustus&mdash;beheld
again the resemblance of those features so deeply engraven on
my heart! My imagination was raised&mdash;methought the lively colours
of the complexion had faded, the benignant smile had vanished, and
an expression of perplexity and sternness usurped its place. I uttered
a faint shriek, and fell lifeless into the arms of my friend. It was some
time before I returned to sense and recollection, when I found myself
on the bed, in the little chamber which had formerly been
appropriated to my use. My friend sat beside me, holding my hand in
her's, which she bathed with her tears. 'Thank God!' she exclaimed,
in a rapturous accent, (as, with a deep sigh, I raised my languid eyes,
and turned them mournfully towards her)&mdash;'she lives!&mdash;My Emma!&mdash;child
of my affections!'&mdash;sobs suppressed her utterance. I drew the
hand, which held mine, towards me&mdash;I pressed it to my bosom&mdash;'<i>My
mother!</i>'&mdash;I would have said; but the tender appellation died away
upon my lips, in inarticulate murmurs.</p>

<p>These severe struggles were followed by a return of my disorder.
Mrs Harley would scarcely be persuaded to quit my chamber for a
moment&mdash;her tenderness seemed to afford her new strength;&mdash;but
these exertions accelerated the progress of an internal malady, which
had for some time past been gaining ground, and gradually
undermining her health.</p>

<p>Youth, and a good constitution, aided by the kind solicitudes of
friendship, restored me, in a few weeks, to a state of convalescence. I
observed the declining strength of my friend with terror&mdash;I accused
myself of having, though involuntarily, added to these alarming
symptoms, by the new fatigues and anxieties which I had occasioned
her. Affection inspired me with those energies, that reason had vainly
dictated. I struggled to subdue myself&mdash;I stifled the impetuous
suggestions of my feelings, in exerting myself to fulfil the duties of
humanity. My mind assumed a firmer tone&mdash;I became, once more,
the cheerful companion, the tender consoler, the attentive nurse, of
this excellent woman, to whose kindness I was so much indebted&mdash;and,
if I stole a few moments in the day, while my friend reposed, to
gaze on the resemblance of Augustus, to weep over the testimonies of
his former respect and friendship, I quickly chased from my bosom,
and my countenance, every trace of sadness, when summoned to
attend my friend.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XIVa" id="ch_XIVa"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p>The winter came on severe and cold. Mrs Harley was forbidden to
expose herself to the frosty air, which seemed to invigorate my
languid frame. I was constituted her almoner, to distribute to the
neighbouring poor the scanty portion, which she was enabled, by a
rigid &oelig;conomy, to spare from her little income: yet the value of this
distribution had been more than redoubled, by the gentler charities
of kind accents, tender sympathy, and wholesome counsels. To these
indigent, but industrious, cottagers, I studied to be the worthy
representative of their amiable benefactress, and found my reward in
their grateful attachment, and the approving smiles of my friend.</p>

<p>By degrees, she ventured to converse with me on the subject
nearest her heart&mdash;the situation of her son. He had been obliged to
yield to the proofs produced of his marriage, which he had, at first,
seemed desirous of evading. He had written, with reserve, upon the
subject to his mother; but, from the enquiries of a common friend,
she had reason to apprehend, that his engagement had been of an
imprudent nature. Two children, were, already the fruits of it: the
mother, with a feminine helplessness of character, had a feeble
constitution. The small fortune, which Augustus had originally
shared with his family, was greatly reduced. His education and habits
had unfitted him for those exertions which the support of an
encreasing family necessarily required:&mdash;his spirits (her friend had
informed her) seemed broken, and his temper soured. Some efforts
had been made to serve him, which his lofty spirit had repelled with
disdain.</p>

<p>This narration deeply affected my heart&mdash;I had resigned myself to
his loss&mdash;but the idea of his suffering, I felt, was an evil infinitely
severer. It was this conviction that preyed incessantly on the peace
and health of his mother. My fortitude failed, when I would have
tried to sustain her; and I could only afford the melancholy
satisfaction of mingling my sorrows with her's.</p>

<p>The disorder of my friend rapidly increased&mdash;her mind became
weakened, and her feelings wayward and irritable. I watched her
incessantly&mdash;I strove, by every alleviating care, to soften her pains.
Towards the approach of spring the symptoms grew more threatening;
and it was judged, by her physician, necessary to apprize her
family of her immediate danger. What a trial for my exhausted heart!
I traced, with a trembling hand, a line to this melancholy purpose&mdash;addressed
it to Mr Harley, and through him to his younger brothers
and sisters.</p>

<p>In a few days they arrived in the village&mdash;sending from the inn a
servant, to prepare their mother for their approach. I gently intimated
to her the visitants we might expect. The previous evening, a change
had taken place, which indicated approaching dissolution; and her
mind (not uncommon in similar cases) seemed, almost instantaneously,
to have recovered a portion of its original strength. She sighed
deeply, while her eyes, which were fixed wistfully on my face, were
lighted with a bright, but transient, lustre.</p>

<p>'My dear Emma,' said she, 'this is a trying moment for us both. I
shall soon close my eyes, for ever, upon all worldly cares.&mdash;Still
cherish, in your pure and ingenuous mind, a friendship for my
Augustus&mdash;the darling of my soul! He may, in future, stand in need
of consolation. I had formed hopes&mdash;vain hopes!&mdash;in which you and
he were equally concerned. In the happiness of this partially-favoured
child&mdash;this idol of my affections&mdash;all mine was concentrated. He has
disappointed me, and I have lost the desire of living&mdash;Yet, he has
noble qualities!&mdash;Who, alas! is perfect? Summon your fortitude,
collect your powers, my child, for this interview!'</p>

<p>She sunk on her pillow&mdash;I answered her only with my tears. A
servant entered&mdash;but spoke not&mdash;her look announced her tidings&mdash;It
caught the eye of Mrs Harley&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let them enter,' said she; and she raised herself, to receive them,
and assumed an aspect of composure.</p>

<p>I covered my face with my handkerchief&mdash;I heard the sound of
footsteps approaching the bed&mdash;I heard the murmurs of filial sorrow&mdash;The
voice of Augustus, in low and interrupted accents, struck upon
my ear&mdash;it thrilled through my nerves&mdash;I shuddered, involuntarily&mdash;What
a moment! My friend spoke a few words, in a faint tone.</p>

<p>'My children,' she added, 'repay to this dear girl,' laying her hand
upon mine, 'the debt of kindness I owe her&mdash;she has smoothed the
pillow of death&mdash;she is an orphan&mdash;she is tender and unfortunate.'</p>

<p>I ventured to remove for a moment the handkerchief from my eyes&mdash;they
met those of Augustus&mdash;he was kneeling by the bed-side&mdash;his
countenance was wan, and every feature sunk in dejection; a
shivering crept through my veins, and chilled my heart with a
sensation of icy coldness&mdash;he removed his eyes, fixing them on his
dying mother.</p>

<p>'My son,' she resumed, in still fainter accents, 'behold in Emma,
your sister&mdash;<i>your friend!</i>&mdash;confide in her&mdash;she is worthy of your
confidence!'&mdash;'Will you not love him, my child,'&mdash;(gazing upon me,)&mdash;'with
a sisterly affection?'</p>

<p>I hid my face upon the pillow of my friend&mdash;I threw my arms
around her&mdash;'Your request is superfluous, my friend, my more than
parent, <i>ah, how superfluous</i>!'</p>

<p>'Forgive me, I know the tenderness of your nature&mdash;yielding, in
these parting moments, to the predominant affection of my heart&mdash;I
fear, I have wounded that tender nature.' 'Farewell, my children!
Love and assist each other&mdash;Augustus, where is your hand?&mdash;my
sight fails me&mdash;God bless you and your little ones&mdash;<i>God bless you all</i>!&mdash;My
last sigh&mdash;my last prayer&mdash;is yours.'</p>

<p>Exhausted by these efforts, she fainted&mdash;Augustus uttered a deep
groan, and raised her in his arms&mdash;but life was fled.</p>

<p>At the remembrance of these scenes, even at this period, my heart
is melted within me.</p>

<p>What is there of mournful magic in the emotions of virtuous
sorrow, that in retracing, in dwelling upon them, mingles with our
tears a sad and sublime rapture? Nature, that has infused so much
misery into the cup of human life, has kindly mixed this strange and
mysterious ingredient to qualify the bitter draught.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XVa" id="ch_XVa"></a>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p>After the performance of the last melancholy duties, this afflicted
family prepared to separate. I received from them, individually,
friendly offers of service, and expressions of acknowledgment, for my
tender attentions to their deceased parent. I declined, for the present,
their invitations, and profferred kindness, though uncertain how to
dispose of myself, or which way to direct my course. Augustus
behaved towards me with distant, cold, respect. I observed in his
features, under a constrained appearance of composure, marks of
deep and strong emotion. I recalled to my mind the injunctions of my
deceased friend&mdash;I yearned to pour into his bosom the balm of
sympathy, but, with an aspect bordering on severity, he repressed the
expression of those ingenuous feelings which formed my character,
and shunned the confidence I so earnestly sought. Unfortunate love
had, in my subdued and softened mind, laid the foundation of a
fervent and durable friendship&mdash;But my love, my friendship, were
equally contemned! I relinquished my efforts&mdash;I shut myself in my
chamber&mdash;and, in secret, indulged my sorrows.</p>

<p>The house of my deceased friend was sold, and the effects
disposed of. On the day previous to their removal, and the departure
of the family for London, I stole into the library, at the close of the
evening, to view, for <i>the last time</i>, the scene of so many delightful, so
many afflicting emotions. A mysterious and sacred enchantment is
spread over every circumstance, even every inanimate object,
connected with the affections. To those who are strangers to these
delicate, yet powerful sympathies, this may appear ridiculous&mdash;but
the sensations are not the less genuine, nor the less in nature. I will
not attempt to analyse them, it is a subject upon which the language
of philosophy would appear frigid, and on which I feel myself every
moment on the verge of fanaticism. Yet, affections like these are not
so much weakness, as strength perhaps badly exerted. Rousseau was,
right, when he asserted, that, 'Common men know nothing of violent
sorrows, nor do great passions ever break out in weak minds. Energy
of sentiment is the characteristic of a noble soul.'</p>

<p>I gazed from the windows on the shrubbery, where I had so often
wandered with my friends&mdash;where I had fondly cherished so many
flattering, so many visionary, prospects. Every spot, every tree, was
associated with some past pleasure, some tender recollection. The
last rays of the setting sun, struggling from beneath a louring cloud,
streamed through its dark bosom, illumined its edges, played on the
window in which I was standing, and gilding the opposite side of the
wainscot, against which the picture of Augustus still hung, shed a soft
and mellow lustre over the features. I turned almost unconsciously,
and contemplated it with a long and deep regard. It seemed to smile
benignly&mdash;it wore no traces of the cold austerity, the gloomy and
inflexible reserve, which now clouded the aspect of the original. I
called to my remembrance a thousand interesting conversations&mdash;when</p>

<blockquote>
<p>'Tuned to happy unison of soul, a fairer world of which the
vulgar never had a glimpse, displayed, its charms.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absorbed in thought, the crimson reflection from the western clouds
gradually faded, while the deep shades of the evening, thickened by
the appearance of a gathering tempest, involved in obscurity the
object on which, without distinctly perceiving it, I still continued to
gaze.</p>

<p>I was roused from this reverie by the sudden opening of the door.
Some person, whom the uncertain light prevented me from
distinguishing, walked across the room, with a slow and solemn pace,
and, after taking several turns backwards and forwards, reclined on
the sopha, remaining for some time perfectly still. A tremor shook my
nerves&mdash;unable either to speak, or to move, I continued silent and
trembling&mdash;my heart felt oppressed, almost to suffocation&mdash;at length,
a deep, convulsive sigh, forced its way.</p>

<p>'My God!' exclaimed the person, whose meditations I had
interrupted, 'what is that?'</p>

<p>It was the voice of Mr Harley, he spoke in a stern tone, though
with some degree of trepidation, and advanced hastily towards the
window against which I leaned.</p>

<p>The clouds had for some hours been gathering dark and gloomy.
Just as Augustus had reached the place where I stood, a flash of
lightning, pale, yet vivid, glanced suddenly across my startled sight,
and discovered to him the object which had alarmed him.</p>

<p>'Emma,' said he, in a softened accent, taking my trembling and
almost lifeless hand, 'how came you here, which way did you enter?'</p>

<p>I answered not&mdash;Another flash of lightning, still brighter, blue and
sulphurous, illuminated the room, succeeded by a loud and long peal
of thunder. Again the heavens seemed to rend asunder and discover
a sheet of livid flame&mdash;a crash of thunder, sudden, loud, short,
immediately followed, bespeaking the tempest near. I started with a
kind of convulsive terror. Augustus led me from the window, and
endeavoured, in vain, to find the door of the library&mdash;the temporary
flashes, and total darkness by which they were succeeded, dazzled
and confounded the sight. I stumbled over some furniture, which
stood in the middle of the room, and unable to recover my feet,
which refused any longer to sustain me, sunk into the arms of
Augustus, suffering him to lift me to the sopha. He seated himself
beside me, the storm continued; the clouds, every moment parting
with a horrible noise, discovered an abyss of fire, while the rain
descended in a deluge. We silently contemplated this sublime and
terrible scene. Augustus supported me with one arm, while my
trembling hand remained in his. The tempest soon exhausted itself
by its violence&mdash;the lightning became less fierce, gleaming at
intervals&mdash;the thunder rolled off to a distance&mdash;its protracted sound,
lengthened by the echoes, faintly died away; while the rain continued
to fall in a still, though copious, shower.</p>

<p>My spirits grew calmer, I gently withdrew my hand from that of
Mr Harley. He once more enquired, but in a tone of greater reserve,
how I had entered the room without his knowledge? I explained,
briefly and frankly, my situation, and the tender motives by which I
had been influenced.</p>

<p>'It was not possible,' added I, 'to take leave of this house <i>for ever</i>,
without recalling a variety of affecting and melancholy ideas&mdash;I feel,
that I have lost <i>my only friend</i>.'</p>

<p>'This world,' said he, 'may not unaptly be compared to the rapids
on the American rivers&mdash;We are hurried, in a frail bark, down the
stream&mdash;It is in vain to resist its course&mdash;happy are those whose
voyage is ended!'</p>

<p>'My friend,' replied I in a faultering voice, 'I could teach my heart
to bear your loss&mdash;though, God knows, the lesson has been
sufficiently severe&mdash;but I know not how, with fortitude, to see you
suffer.'</p>

<p>'Suffering is the common lot of humanity&mdash;but, pardon me, when
I say, your conduct has not tended to lessen my vexations!'</p>

<p>'My errors have been the errors of <i>affection</i>&mdash;Do they deserve this
rigor?'</p>

<p>'Their source is not important, their consequences have been the
same&mdash;you make not the allowances you claim.'</p>

<p>'Dear, and severe, friend!&mdash;Be not unjust&mdash;the confidence which I
sought, and merited, would have been obviated'&mdash;</p>

<p>'I know what you would alledge&mdash;that confidence, you had reason
to judge, was of a painful nature&mdash;it ought not to have been extorted.'</p>

<p>'If I have been wrong, my faults have been severely expiated&mdash;if
the error has been <i>only mine</i>, surely my sufferings have been in
proportion; seduced by the fervor of my feelings; ignorant of your
situation, if I wildly sought to oblige you to chuse happiness through
a medium of my creation&mdash;yet, to have assured <i>yours</i>, was I not
willing to risque all my own? I perceive my extravagance, my views
were equally false and romantic&mdash;dare I to say&mdash;they were the ardent
excesses of a generous mind? Yes! my wildest mistakes had in them a
dignified mixture of virtue. While the institutions of society war
against nature and happiness, the mind of energy, struggling to
emancipate itself, will entangle itself in error'&mdash;</p>

<p>'Permit me to ask you,' interrupted Augustus, 'whether, absorbed
in your own sensations, you allowed yourself to remember, and to
respect, the feelings of others?'</p>

<p>I could no longer restrain my tears, I wept for some moments in
silence&mdash;Augustus breathed a half-suppressed sigh, and turned from
me his face.</p>

<p>'The pangs which have rent my heart,' resumed I, in low and
broken accents, 'have, I confess, been but too poignant! That
lacerated heart still bleeds&mdash;we have neither of us been guiltless&mdash;<i>Alas!
who is?</i> Yet in my bosom, severe feelings are not more painful
than transient&mdash;already have I lost sight of your unkindness, (God
knows how little I merited it!) in stronger sympathy for your sorrows&mdash;whatever
be their nature! We have both erred&mdash;why should we not
exchange mutual forgiveness? Why should we afflict each other?
Friendship, like charity, should suffer all things and be kind!'</p>

<p>'My mind,' replied he coldly, 'is differently constituted.'</p>

<p>'<i>Unpitying man!</i> It would be hard for us, if we were all to be judged
at so severe a tribunal&mdash;you have been a <i>lover</i>,' added I, in a softer
tone, 'and can you not forgive the faults of <i>love</i>?'</p>

<p>He arose, visibly agitated&mdash;I also stood up&mdash;my bosom deeply
wounded, and, unknowing what I did, took his hand, and pressed it
to my lips.</p>

<p>'You have rudely thrown from you a heart of exquisite sensibility&mdash;you
have contemned my love, and you disdain my friendship&mdash;is it
brave, is it manly,' added I wildly&mdash;almost unconscious of what I said&mdash;forgetting
at the moment his situation and my own&mdash;'thus to
triumph over a spirit, subdued by its affections into unresisting
meekness?'</p>

<p>He broke from me, and precipitately quitted the room.</p>

<p>I threw myself upon the floor, and, resting my head on the seat
which Augustus had so lately occupied, passed the night in cruel
conflict&mdash;a tempest more terrible than that which had recently spent
its force, shook my soul! The morning dawned, ere I had power to
remove myself from the fatal spot, where the measure of my
afflictions seemed filled up.&mdash;Virtue may conquer weakness, but who
can bear to be despised by those they love. The sun darted its beams
full upon me, but its splendour appeared mockery&mdash;hope and joy
were for ever excluded from my benighted spirit. The contempt of
the world, the scoffs of ignorance, the contumely of the proud, I
could have borne without shrinking&mdash;but to find myself rejected,
contemned, scorned, by him with whom, of all mankind, my heart
claimed kindred; by him for whom my youth, my health, my powers,
were consuming in silent anguish&mdash;who, instead of pouring balm into
the wound he had inflicted, administered only corrosives!&mdash;<i>It was too
painful!</i> I felt, that I had been a lavish prodigal&mdash;that I had become a
wretched bankrupt; that there was but <i>one way</i> to make me happy and
<i>a thousand</i> to make me miserable! Enfeebled and exhausted, I crawled
to my apartment, and, throwing myself on the bed, gave a loose to the
agony of my soul.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XVIa" id="ch_XVIa"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p>Under pretence of indisposition, I refused to meet the family. I
heard them depart. Too proud to accept of obligation, I had not
confided to them my plans, if plans they could be called, where no
distinct end was in view.</p>

<p>A few hours after their departure, I once more seated myself in a
stage coach, in which I had previously secured a place, and took the
road to London. I perceived, on entering the carriage, only one
passenger, who had placed himself in the opposite corner, and in
whom, to my great surprize, I immediately recognized Mr Montague.
We had not met since the visit he had paid me at Mrs Harley's, the
result of which I have already related: since that period, it had been
reported in the village, that he addressed Sarah Morton, and that
they were about to be united. Montague manifested equal surprize at
our meeting: the intelligence of my friend's death (at which he
expressed real concern) had not reached him, neither was he
acquainted with my being in that part of the country. He had not
lately been at Mr Morton's, he informed me, but had just left his
father's, and was going to London to complete his medical studies.</p>

<p>After these explanations, absorbed in painful contemplation, I for
some time made little other return to his repeated civilities, than by
cold monosyllables: till at length, his cordial sympathy, his gentle
accents, and humane attentions, awakened me from my reverie. Ever
accessible to the soothings of kindness, I endeavoured to exert
myself, to prove the sense I felt of his humanity. Gratified by having
succeeded in attracting my attention, he redoubled his efforts to
cheer and amuse me. My dejected and languid appearance had
touched his feelings, and, towards the end of our journey, his
unaffected zeal to alleviate the anxiety under which I evidently
appeared to labour, soothed my mind and inspired me with
confidence.</p>

<p>He respectfully requested to know in what part of the town I
resided, and hoped to be permitted to pay his respects to me, and to
enquire after my welfare? This question awakened in my bosom so
many complicated and painful sensations, that, after remaining silent
for a few minutes, I burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>'I have no home;' said I, in a voice choaked with sobs&mdash;'I am an
alien in the world&mdash;and alone in the universe.'</p>

<p>His eyes glistened, his countenance expressed the most lively, and
tender, commiseration, while, in a timid and respectful voice, he
made me offers of service, and entreated me to permit him to be
useful to me.</p>

<p>'I then mentioned, in brief, my present unprotected situation, and
hinted, that as my fortune was small, I could wish to procure a
humble, but decent, apartment in a reputable family, till I had
consulted one friend, who, I yet flattered myself, was interested in my
concerns, or till I could fix on a more eligible method of providing for
myself.'</p>

<p>He informed me&mdash;'That he had a distant relation in town, a
decent, careful, woman, who kept a boarding house, and whose
terms were very reasonable. He was assured, would I permit him to
introduce me to her, she would be happy, should her accommodation
suit me, to pay me every attention in her power.'</p>

<p>In my forlorn situation, I confided, without hesitation, in his
recommendation, and gratefully acceded to the proposal.</p>

<p>Mr Montague introduced me to this lady in the most flattering
terms, she received me with civility, but, I fancied, not without a
slight mixture of distrust. I agreed with her for a neat chamber, with a
sitting room adjoining, on the second floor, and settled for the terms
of my board, more than the whole amount of the interest of my little
fortune.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XVIIa" id="ch_XVIIa"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p>I took an early opportunity of addressing a few lines to Mr Francis,
informing him of my situation, and entreating his counsel. I waited a
week, impatiently, for his reply, but in vain: well acquainted with his
punctuality, and alarmed by this silence, I mentioned the step I had
taken, and my apprehensions, to Montague, who immediately
repaired, himself, to the house of Mr Francis; and, finding it shut up,
was informed by the neighbours, that Mr Francis had quitted
England, a short time before, in company with a friend, intending to
make a continental tour.</p>

<p>This intelligence was a new shock to me. I called on some of my
former acquaintance, mentioning to them my wish of procuring
pupils, or of engaging in any other occupation fitted to my talents. I
was received by some with civility, by others with coldness, but every
one appeared too much engrossed by his own affairs to give himself
the trouble of making any great exertion for others.</p>

<p>I returned dispirited&mdash;I walked through the crowded city, and
observed the anxious and busy faces of all around me. In the midst of
my fellow beings, occupied in various pursuits, I seemed, as if in an
immense desart, a solitary outcast from society. Active, industrious,
willing to employ my faculties in any way, by which I might procure
an honest independence, I beheld no path open to me, but that to
which my spirit could not submit&mdash;the degradation of servitude.
Hapless woman!&mdash;crushed by the iron hand of barbarous despotism,
pampered into weakness, and trained the slave of meretricious folly!&mdash;what
wonder, that, shrinking from the chill blasts of penury (which
the pernicious habits of thy education have little fitted thy tender
frame to encounter) thou listenest to the honied accents of the
spoiler; and, to escape the galling chain of servile dependence,
rushest into the career of infamy, from whence the false and cruel
morality of the world forbids thy return, and perpetuates thy disgrace
and misery! When will mankind be aware of the uniformity, of the
importance, of truth? When will they cease to confound, by sexual, by
political, by theological, distinctions, those immutable principles,
which form the true basis of virtue and happiness? The paltry
expedients of combating error with error, and prejudice with
prejudice, in one invariable and melancholy circle, have already been
sufficiently tried, have already been demonstrated futile:&mdash;they have
armed man against man, and filled the world with crimes, and with
blood.&mdash;How has the benign and gentle nature of Reform been
mistated! 'One false idea,' justly says an acute and philosophic
writer,<a name="fn_20r" id="fn_20r"></a><a href="#fn_20"><sup><span class="small">20</span></sup></a> 'united with others, produces such as are necessarily false;
which, combining again with all those the memory retains, give to all
a tinge of falsehood. One error, alone, is sufficient to infect the whole
mass of the mind, and produce an infinity of capricious, monstrous,
notions.&mdash;Every vice is the error of the understanding; crimes and
prejudices are brothers; truth and virtue sisters. These things, known
to the wise, are hid from fools!'</p>

<p>Without a sufficiently interesting pursuit, a fatal torpor stole over
my spirits&mdash;my blood circulated languidly through my veins.
Montague, in the intervals from business and amusement, continued
to visit me. He brought me books, read to me, chatted with me,
pressed me to accompany him to places of public entertainment,
which (determined to incur no pecuniary obligation) I invariably
refused.</p>

<p>I received his civilities with the less scruple, from the information I
had received of his engagement with Miss Morton; which, with his
knowledge of my unhappy attachment, I thought, precluded every
idea of a renewal of those sentiments he had formerly professed for
me.</p>

<p>In return for his friendship, I tried to smile, and exerted my spirits,
to prove my grateful sensibility of his kindness: but, while he
appeared to take a lively interest in my sorrows, he carefully avoided a
repetition of the language in which he had once addressed me; yet, at
times, his tender concern seemed sliding into a sentiment still softer,
which obliged me to practise more reserve: he was not insensible of
this, and was frequently betrayed into transient bursts of passion and
resentment, which, on my repelling with firmness, he would struggle
to repress, and afterwards absent himself for a time.</p>

<p>Unable to devise any method of increasing my income, and
experiencing the pressure of some daily wants and inconveniencies, I
determined, at length, on selling the sum invested, in my name, in
the funds, and purchasing a life annuity.</p>

<p>Recollecting the name of a banker, with whom my uncle, the friend
of my infancy, had formerly kept cash, I learned his residence, and,
waiting upon him, made myself known as the niece of an old and
worthy friend; at the same time acquainting him with my intentions.&mdash;He
offered to transact the affair for me immediately, the funds being,
then, in a very favourable position; and to preserve the money in his
hands till an opportunity should offer of laying it out to advantage. I
gave him proper credentials for the accomplishing of this business,
and returned to my apartment with a heart somewhat lightened. This
scheme had never before occurred to me. The banker, who was a
man of commercial reputation, had assured me, that my fortune
might now be sold out with little loss; and that, by purchasing an
annuity, on proper security, at seven or eight per cent, I might, with
&oelig;conomy, be enabled to support myself decently, with comfort and
independence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XVIIIa" id="ch_XVIIIa"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p>Some weeks elapsed, and I heard no more from my banker. A slight
indisposition confined me to the house. One evening, Mr Montague,
coming to my apartment to enquire after my health, brought with him
a newspaper (as was his frequent custom), and, finding me unwell,
and dispirited, began to read some parts from it aloud, in the hope of
amusing me. Among the articles of home intelligence, a paragraph
stated&mdash;'The failure of a considerable mercantile house, which had
created an alarm upon the Exchange, as, it was apprehended, some
important consequences would follow in the commercial world. A
great banking-house, it was hinted, not many miles from <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, was
likely to be affected, by some rumours, in connection with this
business, which had occasioned a considerable run upon it for the
last two or three days.'</p>

<p>My attention was roused&mdash;I eagerly held out my hand for the
paper, and perused this alarming paragraph again and again, without
observing the surprize expressed in the countenance of Montague,
who was at a loss to conceive why this intelligence should be affecting
to me.&mdash;I sat, for some minutes, involved in thought, till a question
from my companion, several times repeated, occasioned me to start. I
immediately recollected myself, and tried to reason away my fears, as
vague and groundless. I was about to explain the nature of them to
my friend&mdash;secretly accusing myself for not having done so sooner,
and availed myself of his advice, when a servant, entering, put a letter
into his hand.</p>

<p>Looking upon the seal and superscription, he changed colour, and
opened it hastily. Strong emotion was painted in his features while he
perused it. I regarded him with anxiety. He rose from his seat,
walked up and down the room with a disordered pace&mdash;opened the
door, as if with an intention of going out&mdash;shut it&mdash;returned back
again&mdash;threw himself into a chair&mdash;covered his face with his
handkerchief&mdash;appeared in great agitation&mdash;and burst into tears. I
arose, went to him, and took his hand&mdash;'<i>My friend!</i>' said I&mdash;I would
have added something more&mdash;but, unable to proceed, I sunk into a
seat beside him, and wept in sympathy. He pressed my hand to his
lips&mdash;folded me wildly in his arms, and attempted to speak&mdash;but his
voice was lost in convulsive sobs. I gently withdrew myself, and
waited, in silence, till the violence of his emotions should subside. He
held out to me the letter he had received. I perused it. It contained
an account of the sudden death of his father, and a summons for his
immediate return to the country, to settle the affairs, and to take
upon him his father's professional employment.</p>

<p>'You leave me, then!' said I&mdash;'I lose my only remaining friend!'</p>

<p>'<i>Never!</i>'&mdash;he replied, emphatically.</p>

<p>I blushed for having uttered so improper, so selfish, a remark; and
endeavoured to atone for it by forgetting the perils of my own
situation, in attention to that of this ardent, but affectionate, young
man.&mdash;His sufferings were acute and violent for some days, during
which he quitted me only at the hours of repose&mdash;I devoted myself to
sooth and console him. I felt, that I had been greatly indebted to his
friendship and kindness, and I endeavoured to repay the obligation.
He appeared fully sensible of my cares, and, mingled with his
acknowledgments expressions of a tenderness, so lively, and
unequivocal, as obliged me, once more, to be more guarded in my
behaviour.</p>

<p>In consideration for the situation of Mr Montague&mdash;I had
forgotten the paragraph in the paper, till an accidental intelligence of
the bankruptcy of the house, in which my little fortune was entrusted,
confirmed to me the certainty of this terrible blow. Montague was
sitting with me when I received the unwelcome news.</p>

<p>'Gracious God!' I exclaimed, clasping my hands, and raising my
eyes to heaven&mdash;'What is to become of me now?&mdash;The measure of
my sorrows is filled up!'</p>

<p>It was some time before I had power to explain the circumstances
to my companion.</p>

<p>'Do not distress yourself, my lovely Emma,' said he; 'I will be your
friend&mdash;your guardian&mdash;' (and he added, in a low, yet fervent, accent)&mdash;'<i>your
husband</i>!'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;no!' answered I, shaking my head, 'that must not,
cannot, be! I would perish, rather than take advantage of a generosity
like yours. I will go to service&mdash;I will work for my bread&mdash;and, if I
cannot procure a wretched sustenance&mdash;<i>I can but die</i>! Life, to me, has
long been worthless!'</p>

<p>My countenance, my voice, my manner, but too forcibly expressed
the keen anguish of my soul. I seemed to be marked out for the
victim of a merciless destiny&mdash;<i>for the child of sorrow</i>! The susceptible
temper of Montague, softened by his own affliction, was moved by
my distress. He repeated, and enforced, his proposal, with all the
ardour of a youthful, a warm, an uncorrupted, mind.</p>

<p>'You add to my distress,' replied I. 'I have not a heart to bestow&mdash;I
lavished mine upon one, who scorned and contemned it. Its
sensibility is now exhausted. Shall I reward a faithful and generous
tenderness, like yours, with a cold, a worthless, an alienated, mind?
No, no!&mdash;Seek an object more worthy of you, and leave me to my
fate.'</p>

<p>At that moment, I had forgotten the report of his engagement with
Miss Morton; but, on his persisting, vehemently, to urge his suit, I
recollected, and immediately mentioned, it, to him. He confessed&mdash;</p>

<p>'That, stung by my rejection, and preference of Mr Harley, he had,
at one period, entertained a thought of that nature; but that he had
fallen out with the family, in adjusting the settlements. Mrs Morton
had persuaded her husband to make, what he conceived to be,
ungenerous requisitions. Miss Morton had discovered much artifice,
but little sensibility, on the occasion. Disgusted with the apathy of the
father, the insolence of the mother and the low cunning of the
daughter, he had abruptly quitted them, and broken off all
intercourse with the family.'</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enlarge on this part of my narrative. Suffice it
to say, that, after a long contest, my desolate situation, added to the
persevering affection of this enthusiastic young man, prevailed over
my objections. His happiness, he told me, entirely depended on my
decision. I would not deceive him:&mdash;I related to him, with simplicity
and truth, all the circumstances of my past conduct towards Mr
Harley. He listened to me with evident emotion&mdash;interrupted me, at
times, with execrations; and, once or twice, vowing vengeance on
Augustus, appeared on the verge of outrage. But I at length reasoned
him into greater moderation, and obliged him to do justice to the
merit and honour of Mr Harley. He acquiesced reluctantly, and with
an ill grace, yet, with a lover-like partiality, attributed his conduct to
causes, of which I had discerned no traces. He assured himself that
the affections of a heart, tender as mine, would be secured by
kindness and assiduity&mdash;and I at last yielded to his importunity. We
were united in a short time, and I accompanied my husband to the
town of <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, in the county of <span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, the residence of his late
father.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XIXa" id="ch_XIXa"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p>Mr Montague presented me to his relations and friends, by whom I
was received with a flattering distinction. My wearied spirits began
now to find repose. My husband was much occupied in the duties of
his profession. We had a respectable circle of acquaintance: In the
intervals of social engagement, and domestic employment, ever
thirsting after knowledge, I occasionally applied myself to the study of
physic, anatomy, and surgery, <ins title="wtih">with</ins> the various branches of science
connected with them; by which means I frequently rendered myself
essentially serviceable to my friend; and, by exercising my understanding
and humanity, strengthened my mind, and stilled the
importunate suggestions of a heart too exquisitely sensible.</p>

<p>The manners of Mr Montague were kind and affectionate, though
subject, at times, to inequalities and starts of passion; he confided in
me, as his best and truest friend&mdash;and I deserved his confidence:&mdash;yet,
I frequently observed the restlessness and impetuosity of his
disposition with apprehension.</p>

<p>I felt for my husband a rational esteem, and a grateful affection:&mdash;but
those romantic, high-wrought, frenzied, emotions, that had rent
my heart during its first attachment&mdash;that enthusiasm, that
fanaticism, to which opposition had given force, the bare recollection
of which still shook my soul with anguish, no longer existed.
Montague was but too sensible of this difference, which naturally
resulted from the change of circumstances, and was unreasonable
enough to complain of what secured our tranquillity. If a cloud,
sometimes, hung over my brow&mdash;if I relapsed, for a short period, into
a too habitual melancholy, he would grow captious, and complain.</p>

<p>'You esteem me, Emma: I confide in your principles, and I glory in
your friendship&mdash;but, you have never <i>loved</i> me!'</p>

<p>'Why will you be so unjust, both to me, and to yourself?'</p>

<p>'Tell me, then, sincerely&mdash;I know you will not deceive me&mdash;Have
you ever felt for me those sentiments with which Augustus Harley
inspired you?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not&mdash;I do not pretend to it&mdash;neither ought you to wish
it. My first attachment was the morbid excess of a distempered
imagination. Liberty, reason, virtue, usefulness, were the offerings I
carried to its shrine. It preyed incessantly upon my heart, I drank up
its vital spirit, it became a vice from its excess&mdash;it was a pernicious,
though a sublime, enthusiasm&mdash;its ravages are scarcely to be
remembered without shuddering&mdash;all the strength, the dignity, the
powers, of my mind, melted before it! Do you wish again to see me
the slave of my passions&mdash;do you regret, that I am restored to reason?
To you I owe every thing&mdash;life, and its comforts, rational enjoyments,
and the opportunity of usefulness. I feel for you all the affection that
a reasonable and a virtuous mind ought to feel&mdash;that affection which
is compatible with the fulfilling of other duties. We are guilty of vice
and selfishness when we yield ourselves up to unbounded desires,
and suffer our hearts to be wholly absorbed by one object, however
meritorious that object may be.'</p>

<p>'Ah! how calmly you reason,&mdash;while I listen to you I cannot help
loving and admiring you, but I must ever hate that accursed Harley&mdash;No!
<i>I am not satisfied</i>&mdash;and I sometimes regret that I ever beheld you.'</p>

<p>Many months glided away with but little interruptions to our
tranquillity.&mdash;A remembrance of the past would at times obtrude
itself, like the broken recollections of a feverish vision. To banish
these painful retrospections, I hastened to employ myself; every hour
was devoted to active usefulness, or to social and rational recreation.</p>

<p>I became a mother; in performing the duties of a nurse, my
affections were awakened to new and sweet emotions.&mdash;The father of
my child appeared more respectable in my eyes, became more dear to
me: the engaging smiles of my little Emma repayed me for every pain
and every anxiety. While I beheld my husband caress his infant, I
tasted a pure, a chaste, an ineffable pleasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXa" id="ch_XXa"></a>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<p>About six weeks after my recovery from childbed, some affairs of
importance called Mr Montague to London. Three days after he had
quitted me, as, bending over the cradle of my babe, I contemplated
in silence its tranquil slumbers, I was alarmed by an uncommon
confusion in the lower part of the house. Hastening down stairs, to
enquire into the cause, I was informed&mdash;that a gentleman, in passing
through the town, had been thrown from his horse, that he was taken
up senseless, and, as was customary in cases of accident, had been
brought into our house, that he might receive assistance.</p>

<p>Mr Montague was from home, a young gentleman who resided
with us, and assisted my husband in his profession, was also absent,
visiting a patient. Having myself acquired some knowledge of surgery,
I went immediately into the hall to give the necessary directions on
the occasion. The gentleman was lying on the floor, without any signs
of life. I desired the people to withdraw, who, crowding round with
sincere, but useless sympathy, obstructed the circulation of air.
Approaching the unfortunate man, I instantly recognised the well-known
features, though much altered, wan and sunk, of <i>Augustus
Harley</i>. Staggering a few paces backward&mdash;a death-like sickness
overspread my heart&mdash;a crowd of confused and terrible emotions
rushed through my mind.&mdash;But a momentary reflection recalled my
scattered thoughts. Once before, I had saved from death an object so
fatal to my repose. I exerted all my powers, his hair was clotted, and
his face disfigured with blood; I ordered the servants to raise and
carry him to an adjoining apartment, wherein was a large, low sopha,
on which they laid him. Carefully washing the blood from the wound,
I found he had received a dangerous contusion in his head, but that
the scull, as I had at first apprehended, was not fractured. I cut the
hair from the wounded part, and applied a proper bandage. I did
more&mdash;no other assistance being at hand, I ventured to open a vein:
the blood presently flowed freely, and he began to revive. I bathed his
temples, and sprinkled the room with vinegar, opened the windows to
let the air pass freely through, raised his head with the pillows of the
sopha, and sprinkled his face and breast with cold water. I held his
hand in mine&mdash;I felt the languid and wavering pulse quicken&mdash;I
fixed my eyes upon his face&mdash;at that moment every thing else was
forgotten, and my nerves seemed firmly braced by my exertions.</p>

<p>He at length opened his eyes, gazed upon me with a vacant look,
and vainly attempted, for some time, to speak. At last, he uttered a
few incoherent words, but I perceived his senses were wandering,
and I conjectured, too truly, that his brain had received a concussion.
He made an effort to rise, but sunk down again.</p>

<p>'Where am I,' said he, 'every object appears to me double.'</p>

<p>He shut his eyes, and remained silent. I mixed for him a cordial
and composing medicine, and entreating him to take it, he once more
raised himself, and looked up.&mdash;Our eyes met, his were wild and
unsettled.</p>

<p>'That voice,'&mdash;said he, in a low tone, 'that countenance&mdash;Oh God!
where am I?'</p>

<p>A strong, but transient, emotion passed over his features. With a
trembling hand he seized and swallowed the medicine I had offered,
and again relapsed into a kind of lethargic stupor. I then gave orders
for a bed to be prepared, into which I had him conveyed. I darkened
the room, and desired, that he might be kept perfectly quiet.</p>

<p>I retired to my apartment, my confinement was yet but recent, and
I had not perfectly recovered my strength. Exhausted by the strong
efforts I had made, and the stronger agitation of my mind, I sunk into
a fainting fit, (to which I was by no means subject) and remained for
some time in a state of perfect insensibility. On my recovery, I learnt
that Mr Lucas, the assistant of my husband, had returned, and was in
the chamber of the stranger; I sent for him on his quitting the
apartment, and eagerly interrogated him respecting the state of the
patient. He shook his head&mdash;I related to him the methods I had
taken, and enquired whether I had erred? He smiled&mdash;</p>

<p>'You are an excellent surgeon,' said he, 'you acted very properly,
but,' observing my pallid looks, 'I wish your little nursery may not
suffer from your humanity'&mdash;</p>

<p>'I lay no claim,' replied I with emotion&mdash;'to extraordinary humanity&mdash;I
would have done the same for the poorest of my fellow creatures&mdash;but
this gentleman is an old acquaintance, <i>a friend</i>, whom, in the
early periods of my life, I greatly respected.'</p>

<p>'I am sorry for it, for I dare not conceal from you, that I think him
in a dangerous condition.'</p>

<p>I changed countenance&mdash;'There is no fracture, no bones are
broken.'&mdash;</p>

<p>'No, but the brain has received an alarming concussion&mdash;he is
also, otherwise, much bruised, and, I fear, has suffered some internal
injury.'</p>

<p>'You distress and terrify me,' said I, gasping for breath&mdash;'What is
to be done&mdash;shall we call in further advice?'</p>

<p>'I think so; in the mean time, if you are acquainted with his friends,
you would do well to apprize them of what has happened.'</p>

<p>'I know little of them, I know not where to address them&mdash;Oh!
save him,' continued I, clasping my hands with encreased emotion,
unconscious of what I did, 'for God's sake save him, if you would
preserve me from dis&mdash;'</p>

<p>A look penetrating and curious from Lucas, recalled me to reason.
Commending his patient to my care, he quitted me, and rode to the
next town to procure the aid of a skilful and experienced Physician. I
walked up and down the room for some time in a state of distraction.</p>

<p>'He will die'&mdash;exclaimed I&mdash;'die in my house&mdash;fatal accident! Oh,
Augustus! <i>too tenderly beloved</i>, thou wert fated to be the ruin of my
peace! But, whatever may be the consequences, I will perform, for
thee, the last tender offices.&mdash;I will not desert my duty!'</p>

<p>The nurse brought to me my infant, it smiled in my face&mdash;I
pressed it to my bosom&mdash;I wept over it.&mdash;How could I, from that
agitated bosom, give it a pernicious sustenance?</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXIa" id="ch_XXIa"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<p>In the evening, I repaired to the chamber of Mr Harley, I sat by his
bed-side, I gazed mournfully on his flushed, but vacant countenance&mdash;I
took his hand&mdash;it was dry and burning&mdash;the pulse beat rapidly,
but irregularly, beneath my trembling fingers. His lips moved, he
seemed to speak, though inarticulately&mdash;but sometimes raising his
voice, I could distinguish a few incoherent sentences. In casting my
eyes round the room, I observed the scattered articles of his dress,
his cloaths were black, and in his hat, which lay on the ground, I
discovered a crape hatband. I continued to hold his burning hand in
mine.</p>

<p>'She died,'&mdash;said he&mdash;'and my unkindness killed her&mdash;unhappy
Emma&mdash;thy heart was too tender!'&mdash;I shuddered&mdash;'No, no,'&mdash;continued
he, after a few minutes pause, 'she is not married&mdash;she
dared not give her hand without her heart, <i>and that heart was only
mine</i>!' he added something more, in a lower tone, which I was unable
to distinguish.</p>

<p>Overcome by a variety of sensations, I sunk into a chair, and,
throwing my handkerchief over my face, indulged my tears.</p>

<p>Sometimes he mentioned his wife, sometimes his mother.&mdash;At
length, speaking rapidly, in a raised voice&mdash;'My son,'&mdash;said he, 'thou
hast no mother&mdash;but Emma will be a mother to thee&mdash;she will love
thee&mdash;<i>she loved thy father</i>&mdash;her heart was the residence of gentle
affections&mdash;yet, I pierced that heart!'</p>

<p>I suspected, that a confused recollection of having seen me on
recovering from the state of insensibility, in which he had been
brought, after the accident, into our house, had probably recalled the
associations formerly connected with this idea. The scene became too
affecting: I rushed from the apartment. All the past impressions
seemed to revive in my mind&mdash;my thoughts, with fatal mechanism,
ran back into their old and accustomed channels.&mdash;For a moment,
conjugal, maternal, duties, every consideration <i>but for one object</i> faded
from before me!</p>

<p>In a few hours, Mr Lucas returned with the physician;&mdash;I attended
them to the chamber, heedfully watching their looks. The fever still
continued very high, accompanied with a labouring, unsteady pulse, a
difficult respiration, and strong palpitations of the heart. The doctor
said little, but I discovered his apprehensions in his countenance.
The patient appeared particularly restless and uneasy, and the
delirium still continued. On quitting the apartment, I earnestly
conjured the gentlemen to tell me their opinion of the case. They
both expressed an apprehension of internal injury.</p>

<p>'But a short time,' they added, 'would determine it; in the mean
while he must be kept perfectly still.'</p>

<p>I turned from them, and walked to the window&mdash;I raised my eyes
to heaven&mdash;I breathed an involuntary ejaculation&mdash;I felt that the
crisis of my fate was approaching, and I endeavoured to steel my
nerves&mdash;to prepare my mind for the arduous duties which awaited
me.</p>

<p>Mr Lucas approached me, the physician having quitted the room.
'<i>Mrs Montague</i>,' said he, in an emphatic tone&mdash;'in your sympathy for
a <i>stranger</i>, do not forget other relations.'</p>

<p>'I do not need, sir, to be reminded by you of my duties; were not
the sufferings of a fellow being a sufficient claim upon our humanity,
this gentleman has <i>more affecting claims</i>&mdash;I am neither a stranger to
him, nor to his virtues.'</p>

<p>'So I perceive, madam,' said he, with an air a little sarcastic, 'I
wish, Mr Montague were here to participate your cares.'</p>

<p>'I wish he were, sir, his generous nature would not disallow them.'
I spoke haughtily, and abruptly left him.</p>

<p>I took a turn in the garden, endeavouring to compose my spirits,
and, after visiting the nursery, returned to the chamber of Mr Harley.
I there found Mr Lucas, and in a steady tone, declared my intention
of watching his patient through the night.</p>

<p>'As you please, madam,' said he coldly.</p>

<p>I seated myself in an easy chair, reclining my head on my hand.
The bed curtains were undrawn on the side next me. Augustus
frequently started, as from broken slumbers; his respiration grew,
every moment, more difficult and laborious, and, sometimes, he
groaned heavily, as if in great pain. Once he suddenly raised himself
in the bed, and, gazing wildly round the room, exclaimed in a
distinct, but hurried tone&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why dost thou persecute me with thy ill-fated tenderness? A
fathomless gulf separates us!&mdash;Emma!' added he, in a plaintive voice,
'<i>dost thou, indeed, still love me?</i>' and, heaving a convulsive sigh, sunk
again on his pillow.</p>

<p>Mr Lucas, who stood at the feet of the bed, turned his eye on me.
I met his glance with the steady aspect of conscious rectitude. About
midnight, our patient grew worse, and, after strong agonies, was
seized with a vomiting of blood. The fears of the physician were but
too well verified, he had again ruptured the blood-vessel, once before
broken.</p>

<p>Mr Lucas had but just retired, I ordered him to be instantly
recalled, and, stifling every feeling, that might incapacitate me for
active exertion, I rendered him all the assistance in my power&mdash;I
neither trembled, nor shed a tear&mdash;I banished the <i>woman</i> from my
heart&mdash;I acquitted myself with a firmness that would not have
disgraced the most experienced, and veteran surgeon. My services
were materially useful, my solicitude vanquished every shrinking
sensibility, <i>affection had converted me into a heroine</i>! The h&aelig;morrhage
continued, at intervals, all the next day: I passed once or twice from
the chamber to the nursery, and immediately returned. We called in a
consultation, but little hope was afforded.</p>

<p>The next night, Mr Lucas and myself continued to watch&mdash;towards
morning our exhausted patient sunk into an apparently
tranquil slumber. Mr Lucas intreated me to retire, and take some
repose, on my refusal, he availed himself of the opportunity, and went
to his apartment, desiring to be called if any change should take
place. The nurse slept soundly in her chair, I alone remained
watching&mdash;I felt neither fatigue nor languor&mdash;my strength seemed
preserved as by a miracle, so omnipotent is the operation of moral
causes!</p>

<p>Silence reigned throughout the house; I hung over the object of
my tender cares&mdash;his features were serene&mdash;but his cheeks and lips
were pale and bloodless. From time to time I took his lifeless hand&mdash;a
low, fluttering, pulse, sometimes seeming to stop, and then to
vibrate with a tremulous motion, but too plainly justified my fears&mdash;his
breath, though less laborious, was quick and short&mdash;a cold dew
hung upon his temples&mdash;I gently wiped them with my handkerchief,
and pressed my lips to his forehead. Yet, at that moment, that solemn
moment&mdash;while I beheld the object of my virgin affections&mdash;whom I
had loved with a tenderness, 'passing the love of woman'&mdash;expiring
before my eyes&mdash;I forgot not that I was a wife and a mother.&mdash;The
purity of my feelings sanctified their enthusiasm!</p>

<p>The day had far advanced, though the house still remained quiet,
when Augustus, after a deep drawn sigh, opened his eyes. The loss of
blood had calmed the delirium, and though he regarded me
attentively, and with evident surprize, the wildness of his eyes and
countenance had given place to their accustomed steady expression.
He spoke in a faint voice.</p>

<p>'Where am I, how came I here?'</p>

<p>I drew nearer to him&mdash;'An unfortunate accident has thrown you
into the care of kind friends&mdash;you have been very <ins title="original has will">ill</ins>&mdash;it is not
proper that you should exert yourself&mdash;rely on those to whom your
safety is precious.'</p>

<p>He looked at me as I spoke&mdash;his eyes glistened&mdash;he breathed a
half smothered sigh, but attempted not to reply. He continued to
doze at intervals throughout the day, but evidently grew weaker every
hour&mdash;I quitted him not for a moment, even my nursery was
forgotten. I sat, or knelt, at the bed's head, and, between his short
and broken slumbers, administered cordial medicines. He seemed to
take them with pleasure from my hand, and a mournful tenderness at
times beamed in his eyes. I neither spake nor wept&mdash;my strength
appeared equal to every trial.</p>

<p>In the evening, starting from a troubled sleep, he fell into
convulsions&mdash;I kept my station&mdash;our efforts were successful&mdash;he
again revived. I supported the pillows on which his head reclined,
sprinkled the bed cloaths, and bathed his temples, with hungary
water, while I wiped from them the damps of death. A few tears at
length forced their way, they fell upon his hand, which rested on the
pillow&mdash;he kissed them off, and raised to mine his languid eyes, in
which death was already painted.</p>

<p>The blood forsaking the extremities, rushed wildly to my heart, a
strong palpitation seized it, my fortitude had well nigh forsaken me.
But I had been habituated to subdue my feelings, and should I suffer
them to disturb the last moments of him, <i>who had taught me this
painful lesson</i>? He made a sign for a cordial, an attendant offering one&mdash;he
waved his hand and turned from her his face&mdash;I took it&mdash;held it
to his lips, and he instantly drank it. Another strong emotion shook
my nerves&mdash;once more I struggled and gained the victory. He spoke
in feeble and interrupted periods&mdash;kneeling down, scarce daring to
breathe, I listened.</p>

<p>'I have a son,' said he,&mdash;'I am dying&mdash;he will have no longer a
parent&mdash;transfer to him a portion of&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I comprehend you&mdash;say no more&mdash;<i>he is mine</i>&mdash;I adopt him&mdash;where
shall I find&mdash;?'</p>

<p>He pointed to his cloaths;&mdash;'a pocket book'&mdash;said he, in accents
still fainter.</p>

<p>'Enough!&mdash;I swear, in this awful moment, never to forsake him.'</p>

<p>He raised my hand to his lips&mdash;a tender smile illumined his
countenance&mdash;'Surely,' said he, 'I have sufficiently fulfilled the
dictates of a rigid honour!&mdash;In these last moments&mdash;when every
earthly tie is dissolving&mdash;when human institutions fade before my
sight&mdash;I may, without a crime, tell you&mdash;<i>that I have loved you</i>.&mdash;Your
tenderness early penetrated my heart&mdash;aware of its weakness&mdash;I
sought to shun you&mdash;I imposed on myself those severe laws of which
you causelessly complained.&mdash;Had my conduct been less rigid, I had
been lost&mdash;I had been unjust to the bonds which I had voluntarily
contracted; and which, therefore, had on me indispensible claims. I
acted from good motives, but no doubt, was guilty of some errors&mdash;yet,
my conflicts were, even, more cruel than yours&mdash;I had not only
to contend against my own sensibility, but against yours also.&mdash;The
fire which is pent up burns the fiercest!'&mdash;</p>

<p>He ceased to speak&mdash;a transient glow, which had lighted up his
countenance, faded&mdash;exhausted, by the strong effort he had made, he
sunk back&mdash;his eyes grew dim&mdash;they closed&mdash;<i>their last light beamed
on me</i>!&mdash;I caught him in my arms&mdash;and&mdash;<i>he awoke no more</i>. The
spirits, that had hitherto supported me, suddenly subsided. I uttered
a piercing shriek, and sunk upon the body.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXIIa" id="ch_XXIIa"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p>Many weeks passed of which I have no remembrance, they were a
blank in my life&mdash;a long life of sorrow! When restored to
recollection, I found myself in my own chamber, my husband
attending me. It was a long time before I could clearly retrace the
images of the past. I learned&mdash;</p>

<p>'That I had been seized with a nervous fever, in consequence of
having exerted myself beyond my strength; that my head had been
disordered; that Mr Montague on his return, finding me in this
situation, of which Mr Lucas had explained the causes, had been
absorbed in deep affliction; that, inattentive to every other concern,
he had scarcely quitted my apartment; that my child had been sent
out to nurse; and that my recovery had been despaired of.'</p>

<p>My constitution was impaired by these repeated shocks. I
continued several months in a low and debilitated state.&mdash;With
returning reason, I recalled to my remembrance the charge which
Augustus had consigned to me in his last moments. I enquired
earnestly for the pocket-book he had mentioned, and was informed,
that, after his decease, it had been found, and its contents examined,
which were a bank note of fifty pounds, some letters, and
memorandums. Among the letters was one from his brother, by
which means they had learned his address, and had been enabled to
transmit to him an account of the melancholy catastrophe, and to
request his orders respecting the disposal of the body. On the receipt
of this intelligence, the younger Mr Harley had come immediately
into &mdash;&mdash;shire, had received his brother's effects, and had his
remains decently and respectfully interred in the town where the fatal
accident had taken place, through which he was passing in his way to
visit a friend.</p>

<p>As soon as I had strength to hold a pen, I wrote to this gentleman,
mentioning the tender office which had been consigned to me; and
requesting that the child, or children, of Mr Augustus Harley, might
be consigned to my care. To this letter I received an answer, in a few
days, hinting&mdash;</p>

<p>'That the marriage of my deceased friend had not been more
imprudent than unfortunate; that he had struggled with great
difficulties and many sorrows; that his wife had been dead near a
twelve-month; that he had lost two of his children, about the same
period, with the small-pox, one only surviving, the younger, a son, a
year and a half old; that it was, at present, at nurse, under his (his
brother's) protection; that his respect for me, and knowledge of my
friendship for their family, added to his wish of complying with every
request of his deceased brother, prevented him from hesitating a
moment respecting the propriety of yielding the child to my care; that
it should be delivered to any person whom I should commission for
the purpose; and that I might draw upon him for the necessary
charges towards the support and education of his nephew.'</p>

<p>I mentioned to Mr Montague these particulars, with a desire of
availing myself of his counsel and assistance on the occasion.</p>

<p>'You are free, madam,' he replied, with a cold and distant air, 'to
act as you shall think proper; but you must excuse me from making
myself responsible in this affair.'</p>

<p>I sighed deeply. I perceived, but too plainly, that <i>a mortal blow was
given to my tranquillity</i>; but I determined to persevere in what I
considered to be my duty. On the retrospect of my conduct, my heart
acquitted me; and I endeavoured to submit, without repining, to my
fate.</p>

<p>I was, at this period, informed by a faithful servant, who attended
me during my illness, of what I had before but too truly conjectured&mdash;That
in my delirium I had incessantly called upon the name of
Augustus Harley, and repeated, at intervals, in broken language, the
circumstances of our last tender and fatal interview: this, with some
particulars related by Mr Lucas to Mr Montague on his return, had,
it seems, at the time, inflamed the irascible passions of my husband,
almost to madness. His transports had subsided, by degrees, into
gloomy reserve: he had watched me, till my recovery, with
unremitting attention; since which his confidence and affection
became, every day, more visibly alienated. Self-respect suppressed
my complaints&mdash;conscious of deserving, even more than ever, his
esteem, I bore his caprice with patience, trusting that time, and my
conduct, would restore him to reason, and awaken in his heart a
sense of justice.</p>

<p>I sent for my babe from the house of the nurse, to whose care it
had been confided during my illness, and placed the little Augustus
in its stead. 'It is unnecessary, my friend, to say, that you were that
lovely and interesting child.&mdash;Oh! with what emotion did I receive,
and press, you to my care-worn bosom; retracing in your smiling
countenance the features of your unfortunate father! Adopting you
for my own, I divided my affection between you and my Emma.
Scarce a day passed that I did not visit the cottage of your nurse. I
taught you to call me by the endearing name of <i>mother</i>! I delighted to
see you caress my infant with fraternal tenderness&mdash;I endeavoured to
cherish this growing affection, and found a sweet relief from my
sorrows in these tender, maternal, cares.'</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXIIIa" id="ch_XXIIIa"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p>My health being considerably injured, I had taken a young woman
into my house, to assist me in the nursery, and in other domestic
offices. She was in her eighteenth year&mdash;simple, modest, and
innocent. This girl had resided with me for some months. I had been
kind to her, and she seemed attached to me. One morning, going
suddenly into Mr Montague's dressing-room, I surprised Rachel
sitting on a sopha with her master:&mdash;he held her hand in his, while
his arm was thrown round her waist; and they appeared to be
engaged in earnest conversation. They both started, on my entrance:&mdash;Unwilling
to encrease their confusion, I quitted the room.</p>

<p>Montague, on our meeting at dinner, affected an air of unconcern;
but there was an apparent constraint in his behaviour. I preserved
towards him my accustomed manner, till the servants had withdrawn.
I then mildly expostulated with him on the impropriety of his
behaviour. His replies were not more unkind than ungenerous&mdash;they
pierced my heart.</p>

<p>'It is well, sir, I am inured to suffering; but it is not of <i>myself</i> that I
would speak. I have not deserved to lose your confidence&mdash;this is my
consolation;&mdash;yet, I submit to it:&mdash;but I cannot see you act in a
manner, that will probably involve you in vexation, and intail upon
you remorse, without warning you of your danger. Should you
corrupt the innocence of this girl, she is emphatically <i>ruined</i>. It is the
strong mind only, that, firmly resting on its own powers, can sustain
and recover itself amidst the world's scorn and injustice. The
morality of an uncultivated understanding, is that of <i>custom</i>, not of
reason: break down the feeble barrier, and there is nothing to supply
its place&mdash;you open the flood-gates of infamy and wretchedness.
Who can say where the evil may stop?'</p>

<p>'You are at liberty to discharge your servant, when you please,
madam.'</p>

<p>'I think it my duty to do so, Mr Montague&mdash;not on my own, but on
<i>her</i>, account. If I have no claim upon your affection and principles, I
would disdain to watch your conduct. But I feel myself attached to
this young woman, and would wish to preserve her from destruction!'</p>

<p>'You are very generous, but as you thought fit to bestow on me
your <i>hand</i>, when your <i>heart</i> was devoted to another&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It is enough, sir!&mdash;To your justice, only, in your cooler moments,
would I appeal!'</p>

<p>I procured for Rachel a reputable place, in a distant part of the
county.&mdash;Before she quitted me, I seriously, and affectionately,
remonstrated with her on the consequences of her behaviour. She
answered me only with tears and blushes.</p>

<p>In vain I tried to rectify the principles, and subdue the cruel
prejudices, of my husband. I endeavoured to shew him every mark of
affection and confidence. I frequently expostulated with him, upon
his conduct, with tears&mdash;urged him to respect himself and me&mdash;strove
to convince him of the false principles upon which he acted&mdash;of
the senseless and barbarous manner in which he was sacrificing
my peace, and his own, to a romantic chimera. Sometimes he would
appear, for a moment, melted with my tender and fervent entreaties.</p>

<p>'Would to God!' he would say, with emotion, 'the last six months
of my life could be obliterated for ever from my remembrance!'</p>

<p>He was no longer active, and chearful: he would sit, for hours,
involved in deep and gloomy silence. When I brought the little
Emma, to soften, by her engaging caresses, the anxieties by which his
spirits appeared to be overwhelmed, he would gaze wildly upon her&mdash;snatch
her to his breast&mdash;and then, suddenly throwing her from him,
rush out of the house; and, inattentive to the duties of his profession,
absent himself for days and nights together:&mdash;his temper grew, every
hour, more furious and unequal.</p>

<p>He by accident, one evening, met the little Augustus, as his nurse
was carrying him from my apartment; and, breaking rudely into the
room, overwhelmed me with a torrent of abuse and reproaches. I
submitted to his injustice with silent grief&mdash;my spirits were utterly
broken. At times, he would seem to be sensible of the impropriety of
his conduct&mdash;would execrate himself and entreat my forgiveness;&mdash;but
quickly relapsed into his accustomed paroxysms, which, from
having been indulged, were now become habitual, and uncontroulable.
These agitations seemed daily to encrease&mdash;all my efforts to
regain his confidence&mdash;my patient, unremitted, attentions&mdash;were
fruitless. He shunned me&mdash;he appeared, even, to regard me with
horror. I wept in silence. The hours which I passed with my children
afforded me my only consolation&mdash;they became painfully dear to me.
Attending to their little sports, and innocent gambols, I forgot, for a
moment, my griefs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="minimal" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="ch_XXIVa" id="ch_XXIVa"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p>Some months thus passed away, with little variation in my situation.
Returning home one morning, early, from the nurse's, where I had
left my Emma with Augustus (whom I never, now, permitted to be
brought to my own house) as I entered, Mr Montague shot suddenly
by me, and rushed up stairs towards his apartment. I saw him but
transiently, as he passed; but his haggard countenance, and furious
gestures, filled me with dismay. He had been from home the
preceding night; but to these absences I had lately been too much
accustomed to regard them as any thing extraordinary. I hesitated a
few moments, whether I should follow him. I feared, lest I might
exasperate him by so doing; yet, the unusual disorder of his
appearance gave me a thousand terrible and nameless apprehensions.
I crept toward the door of his apartment&mdash;listened attentively, and
heard him walking up and down the room, with hasty steps&mdash;sometimes
he appeared to stop, and groaned heavily:&mdash;once I heard
him throw up the sash, and shut it again with violence.</p>

<p>I attempted to open the door, but, finding it locked, my terror
increased.&mdash;I knocked gently, but could not attract his attention. At
length I recollected another door, that led to this apartment, through
my own chamber, which was fastened on the outside, and seldom
opened. With trembling steps I hurried round, and, on entering the
room, beheld him sitting at a table, a pen in his hand, and paper
before him. On the table lay his pistols&mdash;his hair was dishevelled&mdash;his
dress disordered&mdash;his features distorted with emotion&mdash;while in
his countenance was painted the extreme of horror and despair.</p>

<p>I uttered a faint shriek, and sunk into a chair. He started from his
seat, and, advancing towards me with hurried and tremulous steps,
sternly demanded, Why I intruded on his retirement? I threw myself
at his feet,&mdash;I folded my arms round him&mdash;I wept&mdash;I deprecated his
anger&mdash;I entreated to be heard&mdash;I said all that humanity, all that the
most tender and lively sympathy could suggest, to inspire him with
confidence&mdash;to induce him to relieve, by communication, the
burthen which oppressed his heart.&mdash;He struggled to free himself
from me&mdash;my apprehensions gave me strength&mdash;I held him with a
strenuous grasp&mdash;he raved&mdash;he stamped&mdash;he tore his hair&mdash;his
passion became frenzy! At length, forcibly bursting from him, I fell
on the floor, and the blood gushed from my nose and lips. He
shuddered convulsively&mdash;stood a few moments, as if irresolute&mdash;and,
then, throwing himself beside me, raised me from the ground; and,
clasping me to his heart, which throbbed tumultuously, burst into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>'I will not be thy <i>murderer</i>, Emma!' said he, in a voice of agony,
interrupted by heart-rending sobs&mdash;'I have had enough of blood!'</p>

<p>I tried to sooth him&mdash;I assured him I was not hurt&mdash;I besought
him to confide his sorrows to the faithful bosom of his wife! He
appeared softened&mdash;his tears flowed without controul.</p>

<p>'Unhappy woman!&mdash;you know not what you ask! To be ingenuous,
belongs to purity like yours!&mdash;Guilt, black as hell!&mdash;conscious,
aggravated, damnable, guilt!&mdash;<i>Your fatal attachment</i>&mdash;my accursed
jealousy!&mdash;Ah! Emma! I have injured you&mdash;but you are, indeed,
revenged!'</p>

<p>Every feature seemed to work&mdash;seemed pregnant with dreadful
meaning&mdash;he was relapsing into frenzy.</p>

<p>'Be calm, my friend&mdash;be not unjust to yourself&mdash;you can have
committed no injury that I shall not willingly forgive&mdash;you are
incapable of persisting in guilt. The ingenuous mind, that avows, has
already made half the reparation. Suffer me to learn the source of
your inquietude! I may find much to extenuate&mdash;I may be able to
convince you, that you are too severe to yourself.'</p>

<p>'Never, never, never!&mdash;nothing can extenuate&mdash;<i>the expiation must
be made</i>!&mdash;Excellent, admirable, woman!&mdash;Remember, without
hating, the wretch who has been unworthy of you&mdash;who could not
conceive, who knew not how to estimate, your virtues!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;do not&mdash;do
not'&mdash;straining me to his bosom&mdash;'curse my memory!'</p>

<p>He started from the ground, and, in a moment, was out of sight.</p>

<p>I raised myself with difficulty&mdash;faint, tottering, gasping for breath,
I attempted to descend the stairs. I had scarcely reached the landing-place,
when a violent knocking at the door shook my whole frame. I
stood still, clinging to the balustrade, unable to proceed. I heard a
chaise draw up&mdash;a servant opening the door&mdash;a plain-looking
countryman alighted, and desired instantly to speak to the lady of the
house&mdash;his business was, he said, of life and death! I advanced
towards him, pale and trembling!</p>

<p>'What is the matter, my friend&mdash;whence came you?'</p>

<p>'I cannot stop, lady, to explain myself&mdash;you must come with me&mdash;I
will tell you more as we go along.'</p>

<p>'Do you come,' enquired I, in a voice scarcely articulate, 'from my
husband?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;no&mdash;I come from a person who is dying, who has somewhat
of consequence to impart to you&mdash;Hasten, lady&mdash;there is no time to
lose!'</p>

<p>'Lead, then, I follow you.'</p>

<p>He helped me into the chaise, and we drove off with the rapidity of
lightning.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXVa" id="ch_XXVa"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p>I asked no more questions on the road, but attempted to fortify my
mind for the scenes which, I foreboded, were approaching. After
about an hour's ride, we stopped at a small, neat, cottage,
embosomed in trees, standing alone, at a considerable distance from
the high-road. A decent-looking, elderly, woman, came to the door,
at the sound of the carriage, and assisted me to alight. In her
countenance were evident marks of perturbation and horror. I asked
for a glass of water; and, having drank it, followed the woman, at her
request, up stairs. She seemed inclined to talk, but I gave her no
encouragement&mdash;I knew not what awaited me, nor what exertions
might be requisite&mdash;I determined not to exhaust my spirits
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>On entering a small chamber, I observed a bed, with the curtains
closely drawn. I advanced towards it, and, unfolding them, beheld the
unhappy Rachel lying in a state of apparent insensibility.</p>

<p>'She is dying,' whispered the woman, 'she has been in strong
convulsions; but she could not die in peace without seeing Madam
Montague, and obtaining her forgiveness.'</p>

<p>I approached the unfortunate girl, and took her lifeless hand.&mdash;A
feeble pulse still trembled&mdash;I gazed upon her, for some moments, in
silence.&mdash;She heaved a deep sigh&mdash;her lips moved, inarticulately.
She, at length, opened her eyes, and, fixing them upon me, the blood
seemed to rush through her languid frame&mdash;reanimating it. She
sprung up in the bed, and, clasping her hands together, uttered a few
incoherent words.</p>

<p>'Be pacified, my dear&mdash;I am not angry with you&mdash;I feel only pity.'</p>

<p>She looked wildly. 'Ah! my dear lady, I am a wicked girl&mdash;but not&mdash;Oh,
no!&mdash;<i>not a murderer!</i> I did not&mdash;indeed, I did not&mdash;murder my child!'</p>

<p>A cold tremor seized me&mdash;I turned heart-sick&mdash;a sensation of
horror thrilled through my veins!</p>

<p>'My dear, my kind mistress,' resumed the wretched girl, 'can you
forgive me?&mdash;Oh! that cruel, barbarous, man!&mdash;It was <i>he</i> who did it&mdash;indeed,
it was <i>he</i> who did it!' Distraction glared in her eyes.</p>

<p>'I do forgive you,' said I, in broken accents. 'I will take care of you&mdash;but
you must be calm.'</p>

<p>'I will&mdash;I will'&mdash;replied she, in a rapid tone of voice&mdash;'but do not
send me to prison&mdash;<i>I did not murder it!</i>&mdash;Oh! my child, my child!'
continued she, in a screaming tone of frantic violence, and was again
seized with strong convulsions.</p>

<p>We administered all the assistance in our power. I endeavoured,
with success, to stifle my emotions in the active duties of humanity.
Rachel once more revived. After earnestly commending her to the
care of the good woman of the house, and promising to send
medicines and nourishment proper for her situation, and to reward
their attentions&mdash;desiring that she might be kept perfectly still, and
not be suffered to talk on subjects that agitated her&mdash;I quitted the
place, presaging but too much, and not having, at that time, the
courage to make further enquiries.</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXVIa" id="ch_XXVIa"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p>On entering my own house my heart misgave me. I enquired, with
trepidation, for my husband, and was informed&mdash;'That he had
returned soon after my departure, and had shut himself in his
apartment; that, on being followed by Mr Lucas, he had turned
fiercely upon him, commanding him, in an imperious tone, instantly
to leave him; adding, he had affairs of importance to transact; and
should any one dare to intrude on him, it would be at the peril of
their lives.' All the family appeared in consternation, but no one had
presumed to disobey the orders of their master.&mdash;They expressed
their satisfaction at my return&mdash;Alas! I was impotent to relieve the
apprehensions which, I too plainly perceived, had taken possession of
their minds.</p>

<p>I retired to my chamber, and, with a trembling hand, traced, and
addressed to my husband, a few incoherent lines&mdash;briefly hinting my
suspicions respecting the late transactions&mdash;exhorting him to provide
for his safety, and offering to be the companion of his flight. I added&mdash;'Let
us reap wisdom from these tragical consequences of <i>indulged
passion</i>! It is not to atone for the past error, by cutting off the prospect
of future usefulness&mdash;Repentance for what can never be recalled, is
absurd and vain, but as it affords a lesson for the time to come&mdash;do
not let us wilfully forfeit the fruits of our dear-bought <ins title="original has exerience">experience</ins>! I
will never reproach you! Virtuous resolution, and time, may yet heal
these aggravated wounds. Dear Montague, be no longer the slave of
error; inflict not on my tortured mind new, and more insupportable,
terrors! I await your directions&mdash;let us fly&mdash;let us summon our
fortitude&mdash;let us, at length, bravely stem the tide of passion&mdash;let us
beware of the criminal pusillanimity of despair!'</p>

<p>With faultering steps, I sought the apartment of my husband. I
listened a moment at the door&mdash;and hearing him in motion, while
profound sighs burst every instant from his bosom, I slid my paper
under the door, unfolded, that it might be the more likely to attract
his attention. Presently, I had the satisfaction of hearing him take it
up. After some minutes, a slip of paper was returned, by the same
method which I had adopted, in which was written, in characters
blotted, and scarcely legible, the following words&mdash;</p>

<p>'Leave me, one half hour, to my reflections: at the end of that
period, be assured, I will see, or write, to you.'</p>

<p>I knew him to be incapable of falsehood&mdash;my heart palpitated with
hope. I went to my chamber, and passed the interval in a thousand
cruel reflections, and vague plans for our sudden departure. Near an
hour had elapsed, when the bell rang. I started, breathless, from my
seat. A servant passed my door, to take his master's orders. He
returned instantly, and, meeting me in the passage, delivered to me a
letter. I heard Montague again lock the door.&mdash;Disappointed, I re-entered
my chamber. In my haste to get at the contents of the paper,
I almost tore it in pieces&mdash;the words swam before my sight. I held it
for some moments in my hand, incapable of decyphering the fatal
characters. I breathed with difficulty&mdash;all the powers of life seemed
suspended&mdash;when the report of a pistol roused me to a sense of
confused horror.&mdash;Rushing forward, I burst, with preternatural
strength, into the apartment of my husband&mdash;What a spectacle!&mdash;Assistance
was vain!&mdash;Montague&mdash;the impetuous, ill-fated,
Montague&mdash;<i>was no more&mdash;was a mangled corpse</i>!&mdash;Rash, unfortunate,
young, man!</p>

<p>But, why should I harrow up your susceptible mind, by dwelling on
these cruel scenes? <i>Ah! suffer me to spread a veil over this fearful
catastrophe!</i> Some time elapsed ere I had fortitude to examine the
paper addressed to me by my unfortunate husband. Its contents,
which were as follows, affected me with deep and mingled emotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">TO MRS MONTAGUE.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>'Amidst the reflections which press, by turns, upon my burning
brain, an obscure consciousness of the prejudices upon which my
character has been formed, is not the least torturing&mdash;because I
feel the <i>inveterate force of habit</i>&mdash;I feel, that my convictions come too
late!</p>

<p>'I have destroyed myself, and you, dearest, most generous, and
most unfortunate, of women! I am a monster!&mdash;I have seduced
innocence, and embrued my hands in blood!&mdash;Oh, God!&mdash;Oh,
God!&mdash;<i>'Tis there distraction lies!</i>&mdash;I would, circumstantially, retrace
my errors; but my disordered mind, and quivering hand, refuse the
cruel task&mdash;yet, it is necessary that I should attempt a brief sketch.</p>

<p>'After the cruel accident, which destroyed our tranquillity, I
nourished my senseless jealousies (the sources of which I need not,
now, recapitulate), till I persuaded myself&mdash;injurious wretch that I
was!&mdash;that I had been perfidiously and ungenerously treated.
Stung by false pride, I tried to harden my heart, and foolishly
thirsted for revenge. Your meekness, and magnanimity, disappointed
me.&mdash;I would <ins title="original has willing">willingly</ins> have seen you, not only suffer the
<span class="smallcaps">pangs</span>, but express the <i>rage</i>, of a slighted wife. The simple victim
of my baseness, by the artless affection she expressed for me,
gained an ascendency over my mind; and, when you removed her
from your house, we still contrived, at times, to meet. The
consequences of our intercourse could not long be concealed. It
was, then, that I first began to open my eyes on my conduct, and to
be seized with remorse!&mdash;Rachel, now, wept incessantly. Her
father, she told me, was a stern and severe man; and should he
hear of her misconduct, would, she was certain, be her
destruction. I procured for her an obscure retreat, to which I
removed the unhappy girl [Oh, how degrading is vice!], under false
pretences. I exhorted her to conceal her situation&mdash;to pretend, that
her health was in a declining state&mdash;and I visited her, from time to
time, as in my profession.</p>

<p>'This poor young creature continued to bewail the disgrace she
anticipated&mdash;her lamentations pierced my soul! I recalled to my
remembrance your emphatic caution. I foresaw that, with the loss
of her character, this simple girl's misfortune and degradation
would be irretrievable; and I could, now, plainly distinguish the
morality of <i>rule</i> from that of <i>principle</i>. Pursuing this train of
reasoning, I entangled myself, for my views were not yet
sufficiently clear and comprehensible! Bewildered, amidst contending
principles&mdash;distracted by a variety of emotions&mdash;in seeking
a remedy for one vice, I plunged (as is but too common), into
others of a more scarlet dye. With shame and horror, I confess, I
repeatedly tried, by medical drugs, to procure an abortive birth: the
strength and vigour of Rachel's constitution defeated this diabolical
purpose. Foiled in these attempts, I became hardened, desperate,
and barbarous!</p>

<p>'Six weeks before the allotted period, the infant saw the light&mdash;for
a moment&mdash;to close its eyes on it for ever! I, only, was with the
unhappy mother. I had formed no deliberate purpose&mdash;I had not
yet arrived at the acme of guilt&mdash;but, perceiving, from the babe's
premature birth, and the consequences of the pernicious potions
which had been administered to the mother, that the vital flame
played but feebly&mdash;that life was but as a quivering, uncertain, spark&mdash;a
sudden and terrible thought darted through my mind. I know
not whether my emotion betrayed me to the ear of Rachel&mdash;but,
suddenly throwing back the curtain of the bed, she beheld me
grasp&mdash;with savage ferocity&mdash;<i>with murderous hands</i>!&mdash;Springing
from the bed, and throwing herself upon me&mdash;her piercing
shrieks&mdash;</p>

<p>'<i>I can no more</i>&mdash;of the rest you seem, from whatever means, but
too well informed!</p>

<p>I need not say&mdash;protect, if she survive, the miserable mother!&mdash;To
you, whose heavenly goodness I have so ill requited, it would
be injurious as unnecessary! I read, too late, the heart I have
insulted!</p>

<p>'I have settled the disposal of my effects&mdash;I have commanded
my feelings to give you this last, sad, proof of my confidence.&mdash;<i>Kneeling</i>,
I entreat your forgiveness for the sufferings I have caused
you! I found your heart wounded&mdash;and into those festering
wounds I infused a deadly venom&mdash;curse not my memory&mdash;<i>We
meet no more</i>.</p>

<p>'Farewel! first, and last, and only, beloved of women!&mdash;a long&mdash;a
long farewel!</p>

<p class="right">
'<span class="smallcaps">Montague</span>.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the consequences of confused systems of morals&mdash;and
thus it is, that minds of the highest hope, and fairest prospect, are
blasted!</p>

<h3><a name="ch_XXVIIa" id="ch_XXVIIa"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p>The unhappy Rachel recovered her health by slow degrees. I had
determined, when my affairs were settled, to leave a spot, that had
been the scene of so many tragical events. I proposed to the poor girl
to take her again into my family, to which she acceded with rapture.
She has never since quitted me, and her faithful services, and
humble, grateful attachment, have repaid my protection an hundred
fold.</p>

<p>Mr Montague left ten thousand pounds, the half of which was
settled on his daughter, the remainder left to my disposal. This
determined me to adopt you wholly for my son. I wrote to your uncle
to that purport, taking upon myself the entire charge of your
education, and entreating, that you might never know, unless
informed by myself, to whom you owed your birth. That you should
continue to think me <i>your mother</i>, flattered my tenderness, nor was
my Emma, herself, more dear to me.</p>

<p>I retired in a few months to my present residence, sharing my heart
and my attentions between my children, who grew up under my
fostering care, lovely and beloved.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>I observed your affection for each other with a flattering presage.
With the features of your father, you inherited his intrepidity, and
manly virtues&mdash;even, at times, I thought I perceived the seeds of his
inflexible spirit; but the caresses of my Emma, more fortunate than
her mother&mdash;yet, with all her mother's sensibility&mdash;could, in an
instant, soften you to tenderness, and melt you into infantine
sweetness.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to form your young minds to every active virtue, to
every generous sentiment.&mdash;You received, from the same masters,
the same lessons, till you attained your twelfth year; and my Emma
emulated, and sometimes outstripped your progress. I observed, with
a mixture of hope and solicitude, her lively capacity&mdash;her enthusiastic
affections; while I laboured to moderate and regulate them.</p>

<p>It now became necessary that your educations should take a
somewhat different direction; I wished to fit you for a commercial
line of life; but the ardor you discovered for science and literature
occasioned me some perplexity, as I feared it might unfit you for
application to trade, in the pursuit of which so many talents are
swallowed up, and powers wasted. Yet, as to the professions my
objections were still more serious.&mdash;The study of law, is the study of
chicanery.&mdash;The church, the school of hypocrisy and usurpation!
You could only enter the universities by a moral degradation, that
must check the freedom, and contaminate the purity, of the mind,
and, entangling it in an inexplicable maze of error and contradiction,
<i>poison virtue at its source</i>, and lay the foundation for a duplicity of
character and a perversion of reason, destructive of every manly
principle of integrity. For the science of physic you expressed a
disinclination. A neighbouring gentleman, a surveyor, a man high in
his profession, and of liberal manners, to whose friendship I was
indebted, offered to take you. You were delighted with this proposal,
(to which I had no particular objection) as you had a taste for drawing
and architecture.</p>

<p>Our separation, though you were to reside in the same town, cost
us many tears&mdash;I loved you with more than a mother's fondness&mdash;and
my Emma clung round the neck of her beloved brother, her
Augustus, her playfellow, and sobbed on his bosom. It was with
difficulty that you could disentangle yourself from our embraces.
Every moment of leisure you flew to us&mdash;my Emma learned from you
to draw plans, and to study the laws of proportion. Every little
exuberance in your disposition, which, generated by a noble pride,
sometimes wore the features of asperity, was soothed into peace by
her gentleness and affection: while she delighted to emulate your
fortitude, and to rise superior to the feebleness fostered in her sex,
under the specious name of delicacy. Your mutual attachment
encreased with your years, I renewed my existence in my children,
and anticipated their more perfect union.</p>

<p>Ah! my son, need I proceed? Must I continually blot the page with
the tale of sorrow? Can I tear open again, can I cause to bleed afresh,
in your heart and my own, wounds scarcely closed? In her fourteenth
year, in the spring of life, your Emma and mine, lovely and fragile
blossom, was blighted by a killing frost&mdash;After a few days illness, she
drooped, faded, languished, and died!</p>

<p>It was now that I felt&mdash;'That no agonies were like the agonies of a
mother.' My broken spirits, from these repeated sorrows, sunk into
habitual, hopeless, dejection. Prospects, that I had meditated with
ineffable delight, were for ever veiled in darkness. Every earthly tie
was broken, except that which bound you to my desolated heart with
a still stronger cord of affection. You wept, in my arms, the loss of
her whom you, yet, fondly believed your sister.&mdash;I cherished the
illusion lest, by dissolving it, I should weaken your confidence in my
maternal love, weaken that tenderness which was now my only
consolation.</p>

<div class="center">
<p>TO AUGUSTUS HARLEY.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>My Augustus, <i>my more than son</i>, around whom my spirit, longing
for dissolution, still continues to flutter! I have unfolded the errors
of my past life&mdash;I have traced them to their source&mdash;I have laid
bare my mind before you, that the experiments which have been
made upon it may be beneficial to yours! It has been a painful, and
a humiliating recital&mdash;the retrospection has been marked with
anguish. As the enthusiasm&mdash;as the passions of my youth&mdash;have
passed in review before me, long forgotten emotions have been
revived in my lacerated heart&mdash;it has been again torn with <i>the pangs
of contemned love</i>&mdash;the disappointment of rational plans of
usefulness&mdash;the dissolution of the darling hopes of maternal pride
and fondness. The frost of a premature age sheds its snows upon
my temples, the ravages of a sickly mind shake my tottering frame.
The morning dawns, the evening closes upon me, the seasons
revolve, without hope; the sun shines, the spring returns, but, to
me, it is mockery.</p>

<p>And is this all of human life&mdash;this, that passes like a tale that is
told? Alas! it is a tragical tale! Friendship was the star, whose
cheering influence I courted to beam upon my benighted course.
The social affections were necessary to my existence, but they have
been only inlets to sorrow&mdash;<i>yet, still, I bind them to my heart</i>!</p>

<p>Hitherto there seems to have been something strangely wrong in
the constitutions of society&mdash;a lurking poison that spreads its
contagion far and wide&mdash;a canker at the root of private virtue and
private happiness&mdash;a principle of deception, that sanctifies error&mdash;a
Circean cup that lulls into a fatal intoxication. But men begin to
think and reason; reformation dawns, though the advance is tardy.
Moral martyrdom may possibly be the fate of those who press
forward, yet, their generous efforts will not be lost.&mdash;Posterity will
plant the olive and the laurel, and consecrate their mingled
branches to the memory of such, who, daring to trace, to their
springs, errors the most hoary, and prejudices the most venerated,
emancipate the human mind from the trammels of superstition,
and teach it, <i>that its true dignity and virtue, consist in being free</i>.</p>

<p>Ere I sink into the grave, let me behold the <i>son of my affections</i>,
the living image of him, whose destiny involved mine, who gave an
early, but a mortal blow, to all my worldly expectations&mdash;let me behold
my Augustus, escaped from the tyranny of the passions, restored to
reason, to the vigor of his mind, to self controul, to the dignity of
active, intrepid virtue!</p>

<p>The dawn of my life glowed with the promise of a fair and bright
day; before its noon, thick clouds gathered; its mid-day was gloomy
and tempestuous.&mdash;It remains with thee, my friend, to gild with a
mild radiance the closing evening; before the scene shuts, and veils
the prospect in impenetrable darkness.
